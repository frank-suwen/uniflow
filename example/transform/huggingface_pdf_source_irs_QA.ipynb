    "# Example of generating QAs for IRS\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how to generate question-answers (QAs) from a pdf using Huggingface's models via `uniflow`'s [OpenAIJsonModelFlow](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/blob/main/uniflow/flow/model_flow.py#L125).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we're using a [10K from Nike](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to `uniflow` conda environment to run this notebook. You can set up the environment following the instruction: https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to run the code. Once you have the key, set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` within a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository. For more details, see this [instruction](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#api-keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are storing the Nike 10K in the `data\\raw_input` directory as \"nike-10k-2023.pdf\". You can download the file from [here](https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_downloads/2023/414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf)."

      " ## What's New for 2022 The following items highlight some changes in the tax law for 2022. **Form 1098-k reporting transition period.** The transition period described in _Notice 2023-10_ delays the reporting of transactions in excess of 5600 to transactions that occur after calendar year 2022. The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired.

      " ### Deducting Business Expenses Page 5* You have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business. If you have more than one business location, determine your principal place of business based on the following factors. * The relative importance of the activities performed at each location. * If the relative importance factor does not determine your principal place of business, consider the time spent at each location. _Optional safe harbor method._ Individual taxpayers can use the optional safe harbor method to determine the amount of deductible expenses attributable to certain business use of a residence during the tax year. This method is an alternative to the calculation, allocation, and substantiation of actual expenses. The deduction under the optional method is limited to $1,500 per year based on $5 per square foot for up to 300 square feet. Under this method, you claim your allowable mortag interest, real estate taxes, and casually losses on the home as itemized deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). You are not required to allocate these deductions between personal and business uses, as is required under the regular method. If you use the optional method, you cannot depreciate the portion of your home used in a trade or business. Business expenses unrelated to the home, such as advertising, supplies, and wages paid to employees, are still fully deductible. All of the requirements discussed earlier under _Business use of your home_ still apply. For more information on the deduction for business use of your home, including the optional safe harbor method, see Pub. 587. _If you were entitled to deduct depreciation on the part of your home used for business, you cannot exclude the part of the gain from the sale of your home that equals any depreciation you deducted (or could have deducted) for periods after May 6, 1997._ **Business use of your car.** If you use your car exclusively in your business, you can deduct car expenses. If you use your car for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual mileage. Generally, commuting expenses between your home and your business location, within the area of your tax home, are not deductible. You can deduct actual car expenses, which include depreciation (or lease payments), gas and oil, fires, repairs, tune-ups, insurance, and registration fees. Or, instead of figuring the business part of these actual expenses, you may be able to use the standard mileage rate to figure your deduction. For 2022, the standard mileage rate is 58.5 cents per mile before July 1, 2022, and 62.5 cents per mile on or after July 1, 2022. To find the standard mileage rate for 2023, go to _(IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates_. If you are self-employed, you can also deduct the business part of interest on your car loan, state and local personal property tax on the car, parking fees, and tolls, whether or not you claim the standard mileage rate. For more information on car expenses and the rules for using the standard mileage rate, see Pub. 463. _If you use your car for business, you must keep records of all miles driven, the dates of travel, the purpose of the trip, and the number of passengers. You must also keep records of all expenses related to the car, such as fuel, oil changes, repairs, and maintenance._ **Business use of your computer and internet access.** If you use your computer and internet access exclusively for your business, you can deduct the cost of the equipment and the cost of internet service. However, if you use your computer and internet access for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual usage. To determine how much of your computer and internet access costs are business expenses, you need to know how much time you spend using them for business purposes. Keep track of the time you spend using your computer and internet access for business purposes, and then divide your total expenses by the percentage of time you spend using them for business purposes. For example, if you spend 60% of your time using your computer and internet access for business purposes, you would be able to deduct 60% of the cost of the equipment and the cost of internet service. For more information on deducting business expenses for computers and internet access, see Pub. 539. _If you use your computer and internet access for business, you must keep records of the time you spend using them for business purposes, the cost of the equipment and the cost of internet service, and the percentage of time you spend using them for business purposes._ **Busness use of your phone.** If you use your phone exclusively for your business, you can deduct phone expenses. If you use your phone for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual usage. To determine how much of your phone expenses are business expenses, you need to know how much time you spend using it for business purposes. Keep track of the time you spend using your phone for business purposes, and then divide your total expenses by the percentage of time you spend using it for business purposes. For example, if you spend 60% of your time using your phone for business purposes, you would be able to deduct 60% of your phone expenses. For more information on deducting business expenses for phones, see Pub. 539. _If you use your phone for business, you must keep records of the time you spend using it for business purposes, the cost of the phone, and the percentage of time you spend using it for business purposes._\n",

      " ## How Much Can I **Deduct?** Generally, you can deduct the full amount of a business expense if it meets the criteria of ordinary and necessary and it is not a capital expense. **Recovery of amount deducted (tax benefit rule).** If you recover part of an expense in the same tax year in which you would have claimed a deduction, reduce your current year expense by the amount of the recovery. If you have a recovery in a later year, include the recovered amount in income in that year. However, if part of the deduction for the expense did not reduce your tax, you do not have to include that part of the recovered amount in income. For more information on recoveries and the tax benefit rule, see Pub. 525. **Payments in kind.** If you provide services to pay a business expense, the amount you can deduct is limited to your out-of-pocket costs. You cannot deduct the cost of your own labor. Similarly, if you pay a business expense in goods or other property, you can deduct only what the property costs you. If these costs are included in the cost of goods sold, do not deduct them again as a business expense. **Limits on losses.** If your deductions for an investment or business activity are more than the income it brings in, you have a loss. There may be limits on how much of the loss you can deduct. **Not-for-profit limits.** If you carry on your business activity without the intention of making a profit, you cannot use a loss from it to offset other income. For more information, see _Not-for-profit Activities_, later. **At-risk limits.** Generally, a deductible loss from a trade or business or other income-producing activity is limited to the investment you have \"at risk\" in the activity. You are at risk in any activity for the following. 1. The money and adjusted basis of property you contribute to the activity.\n",

      " ## When Can I **Deduct an Expense?** When you can deduct an expense depends on your accounting method. An accounting method is a set of rules used to determine when and how income and expenses are reported. The two basic methods are the cash method and the accrual method. Whichever method you choose must clearly reflect income. For more information on accounting methods, see Pub. 538. **Cash method.** Under the cash method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses in the tax year you pay them. **Accural method.** Under the accrual method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses when both of the following apply.\n",

      " ## 4 Awards You can generally deduct amounts you pay to your employees as awards, whether paid in cash or property. If you give property to an employee as an employee achievement award, your deduction may be limited. **Achievement awards.** An achievement award is an item of tangible personal property that meets all the following requirements. * It is given to an employee for length of service or safety achievement. * It is awarded as part of a meaningful presentation. * It is awarded under conditions and circumstances that don't create a significant likelihood of disguised pay. _Tangle personal property._ An award isn't an item of tangible personal property if it is an award of cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements granting only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited assortment of items preselected or preapproved by you). Also, tangible personal property doesn't include vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items. _Length-of-service award._ An award will qualify as a length-of-service award only if either of the following applies. * The employee receives the award after their first 5 years of employment. * The employee didn't receive another length-of-service award (other than one of very small value) during the same year or in any of the prior 4 years. _Safety achievement award._ An award for safety achievement will qualify as an achievement award unless one of the following applies. 1. It is given to a manager, administrator, clerical employee, or other professional employee. 2. During the tax year, more than 10% of your employees, excluding those listed in (1), have already received a safety achievement award (other than one of very small value). _Deduction limit._ Your deduction for the cost of employee achievement awards given to any one employee during the tax year is limited to the following. * S400 for awards that aren't qualified plan awards. * S1,600 for all awards, whether or not qualified plan awards. A qualified plan award is an achievement award given as part of an established written plan or program that doesn't favor highly compensated employees as to eligibility or benefits. A highly compensated employee is an employee who meets either of the following tests. 1. The employee was a 5% owner at any time during the year or the preceding year. 2. The employee received more than $130,000 in pay for the preceding year. You can choose to ignore test (2) if the employee wasn't also in the top 20% of employees when ranked by pay for the preceding year. An award isn't a qualified plan award if the average cost of all the employee achievement awards given during the tax year (that would be qualified plan awards except for this limit) is more than $400. To figure this average cost, ignore awards of nominal value. Deduct achievement awards, up to the maximum amounts listed earlier, as a nonwage business expense on your return or business schedule. _You may not over employment taxes on the value of some achievement awards you provide an employee. See Pub. 15-B._\n",

      " ## 6 Fringe Benefits A fringe benefit is a form of pay for the performance of services. You can generally deduct the cost of fringe benefits. You may be able to exclude all or part of the value of some fringe benefits from your employers' pay. You also may not use employment taxes on the value of the fringe benefits. See Table 2-1 in Pub. 15-B for details. Generally, no deduction is allowed for activities generally considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or for a facility used in connection with such activity. However, you may deduct these expenses if the goods, services, or facilities are treated as compensation to the recipient and reported on Form W-2 for an employee or on Form 1099-NEC for an independent contract. If the recipient is an officer, director, beneficial owner (directly or indirectly), or other \"specified individual\" (as defined in section 274(e)(2)(B) and Regulations section 1.274-9(b), special rules apply. See section 274(e)(2) and Regulations sections 1.274-9 and 1.274-10. Certain fringe benefits are discussed next. See Pub. 15-B for more details on these and other fringe benefits. Meals and lodging.Generally, you can deduct 50% of certain meal expenses and 100% of certain lodging expenses provided to your employees. If the amounts are deductible, deduct the cost in whatever category the expense falls. Deduction limit on mealsYou can generally deduct only 50% of the cost of furnishing meals to your employees. However, you can deduct the full cost of certain meals; see section 274(n)(2) and Regulations section 1.274-12(c) for more information. For example, you can deduct the full cost of the following meals. Meals whose value you include in an employee's wages. Meals you furnish to your employees as part of the expense of providing recreational or social activities, such as holiday parties or annual prichens, when made primarily for the benefit of your employees other than employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners who own a 10% or greater interest in your business, or other highly compensated employees. Meals you furnish to your employees at the work site when you operate a restaurant or catering service. Meals you/re required by federal law to furnish to crew members of certain commercial vessels (or would be required to furnish if the vessels were operated at sea). This doesn't include such furnish on vessels primarily providing luxury water transportation. Meals you furnish on an oil or gas platform or drilling rig located offshore or in Alaska. This includes meals you furnish at a support cam that is near and integral to an oil or gas drilling rig located in Alaska. P.L. 115-97, Tax Cuts and Jobs Actchanged the rules for the deduction of food or beverage expenses that are excluelable from employee income as a de minimising fringe benefit. For amounts incurred or paid after 2017, the 50% limit on deductions for food or beverage expenses also applies to food or beverage expenses excludeable from employee income as a dub minis fringe benefit. While your business deduction may be limited, the rules that allow you to exclude certain de minimis meals and meals on your business premises from your employee's wages still apply. See Meals in section 2 of Pub. 15-B. Food and beverage expense incurred together with entertainment expensesP.L. 115-97 changed the rules for the deduction of business entertainment expenses. For amounts incurred or paid after 2017, no business deduction is allowed for any item generally considered to be entertainment, amusement, or recreation. As discussed earlier, you can deduct 50% of the cost of business meals. If food and beverages are provided during or at an entertainment activity, and the food and beverages are purchased separately from the entertainment, or the cost of the food and beverages is stated separately from the intent on one or more bills, involos, or recebits, you may continue to deduct 50% of the business meal expenses. The amount charged for food or beverages on a bill, invice, or receipt must reflect the venue's usual selling cost for those items if they were to be purchased separately from the entertainment or must approximate the reasonable value of those items. If you purchase food and beverages together with entertainment expenses and the cost of the food and beverages isn't stated separately on the invice, the cost of the food and beverages is also an entertainment expense and none of the expenses are deductible. For more information, including details about additional requirements that must be met for a business meal to be deductible, see Regulations sections 1.274-11 and 1.274-12(a).\n",

      " ## Property If you transfer property (including your company's stock) to an employee as payment for services, you can generally deduct it as wages. The amount you can deduct is the property's fair market value (FMV) on the date of the transfer less any amount the employee paid for the property. You can claim the deduction only for the tax year in which your employee includes the property's value in their income. Your employee is deemed to have included the value in their income if you report it on their Form W-2 in a timely manner. You treat the deductible amount as received in exchange for the property, and you must recognize any gain or loss realized on the transfer, unless it is the company's stock transferred as payment for services. Your gain or loss is the difference between the FMV of the property and its adjusted basis on the date of transfer. These rules also apply to property transferred to an independent contractor for services, generally reported on Form 1099-NEC. **Restricted property.** If the property you transfer for services is subject to restrictions that affect its value, you generally cart deduct it and don't report gain or loss until it is substantially used in the recipient. However, if the recipient pays for the property, you must report any gain at the time of the transfer up to the amount paid. \"Substantially vested\" means the property isn't subject to a substantial risk of definitive. This means that the recipient isn't likely to have to give up their rights in the property in the future. For example, if the property is restricted by a vesting period, it is considered substantially vested when the vesting period has ended. **Qualified plan contributions.** Contributions made to qualified plans are generally not subject to federal income taxes. They are treated as after-tax dollars because they are made with money that has already been taxed. However, contributions made to certain types of qualified plans may be eligible for special tax benefits, such as Roth IRA contributions. **Retirement savings accounts.** Retirement savings accounts, such as traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, allow individuals to save for retirement while deferring federal income taxes on their contributions. These accounts are designed to encourage long-term saving and investment. **Annuities.** An annuities are contracts with insurance companies where you make a lump sum payment in exchange for guaranteed income payments over a specified period of time. An annuity provides a steady stream of income during retirement.\n",

      " ## 3. **Rent Expense** The rent expense is a common type of expense that many people face every day. It can be difficult to keep track of all the different types of expenses and their corresponding amounts. One way to simplify this process is by using an app or software program designed specifically for tracking rent expenses. These programs typically allow users to input information about each rental payment, such as the amount paid, date paid, and any additional notes or comments. They also provide tools for organizing and analyzing this data, making it easier to understand how much money is being spent on rent over time. Additionally, some apps may offer features like budgeting and financial planning, which can help users make informed decisions about their spending habits. Overall, these tools can be incredibly useful for anyone looking to better manage their rent expenses.\n",

      " ## Cost of Getting a Lease You may either enter into a new lease with the lowest of the property or get an existing lease from another leasesee. Very often when you get an existing lease from another leasesee, you must pay the previous lessee money to get the lease, besides having to pay the rent on the lease. If you get an existing lease on property or equipment for your business, you must generally amortize any amount you pay to get that lease over the remaining term of the lease. For example, if you pay $10,000 to get a lease and there are 10 years remaining on the lease with no option to renew, you can deduct $1,000 each year. The cost of getting an existing lease of tangible property is not subject to the amortization rules for section 197 intangibles discussed in chapter 8. **Option to renew.** The term of the lease for amortization includes all renewal options plus any other period for which you and the leossor reasonably expect the lease to be renewed. However, this applies only if less than 75% of the cost of getting the lease is for the term remaining on the purchase date (not including any period for which you may choose to renew, extend, or continue the lease). Allocate the lease cost to the original term and any option term based on the facts and circumstances. In some cases, it may be appropriate to make the allocation using a present value calculation. For more information, see Regulations section 1.178-1(b)(5).\n",

      " ## Improvements If you add buildings or make other permanent improvements to leased property, depreciate the cost of the improvements using the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS). Depreciate the property over its appropriate recovery period. You can't amortize the cost over the remaining term of the lease. If you don't keep the improvements when you end the lease, figure your gain or loss based on your adjusted basis in the improvements at that time. For more information, see the discussion of MACRS in chapter 4 of Pub. 946. **Assignment of a lease.** If a long-term leasee who makes permanent improvements to land later assigns all lease rights to you for money and you pay the rent required by the lease, the amount you pay for the assignment is a capital investment. If the rental value of the leased land increased since the lease began, part of your capital investment is for that increase in the rental value. The rest is for your investment in the permanent improvements. The part that is for the increased rental value of the land is a cost of getting a lease, and you amortize it over the remaining term of the lease. You can depreciate the part that is for your investment in the improvements over the recovery period of the property as discussed earlier, without regard to the lease term. **Disposition of a lease.** When you dispose of a long-term lease, you recognize any unpaid portion of the rent as income if you have received payment from the lessee before the date of disposal. Otherwise, you recognize the unpaid portion of the rent as an expense. You also recognize any gain or loss on the sale of the leasehold interest. If you sell the leasehold interest for less than your adjusted basis in the leasehold interest, you recognize a loss. If you sell the leasehold interest for more than your adjusted basis in the leasehold interest, you recognize a gain. **Leasehold improvement costs.** Leasehold improvement costs are deductible expenses if they are paid out during the tax year. However, if you expect to receive reimbursement for these costs from the lessee, you must include them in gross income unless you can establish that the reimbursement is not taxable under section 7203(a)(5). **Depreciation of leasehold improvements.** Leasehold improvements made after January 1, 1987, are subject to bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation allows you to deduct a percentage of the cost of qualifying leasehold improvements in the year they are placed in service. For example, if you place $10,000 in leasehold improvements in service on July 1, 1987, you may be able to deduct up to $5,000 ($10,000 x 50%) in the year of placement. Any unused bonus depreciation carries forward to future years until used up. **Tax treatment of leasehold improvements.** Leasehold improvements made after January 1, 1987, are generally treated as personal property for tax purposes. This means that they are depreciated using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), which is described in chapter 4 of Pub. 946. **Elective accounting method.** Under the elective accounting method, you can choose to account for leasehold improvements separately from the building structure. This method requires you to calculate the depreciation of the building structure and leasehold improvements separately. To use this method, you must meet certain requirements set forth in IRC section 446(b)(1).\n",

      " ## 4 Capitalizing **Rent Expenses** Under the uniform capitalization rules, you must capitalize the direct costs and part of the indirect costs for certain production or resale activities.

You recover the costs through depreciation, amortization, or cost of goods sold when you use, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property.

      " # Allocation of Interest The rules for deducting interest vary, depending on whether the loan proceeds are used for business, personal, or investment activities. If you use the proceeds of a loan for more than one type of expense, you must allocate the interest based on the use of the loan's proceeds. Allocate your interest expense to the following categories. Nompassive trade or business activity interest. Passive trade or business activity interest. Investment interest. Portfolio interest. Personal interest. In general, you allocate interest on a loan the same way you allocate the loan proceeds. You allocate loan proceeds by tracing disbursments to specific uses. The easiest way to trace disbursements to specific uses is to keep the proceeds of a particular loan separate from any other funds. Secured loan.The allocation of loan proceeds and the related interest is generally not affected by the use of property that secures the loan. Marge and Jeff secure a loan with property used in their business. They use the loan proceeds to buy an automobile for personal use. Jeff and Margo must allocate interest expense on the loan to personal use (purchase of the automobile) even though the loan is secured by business property. P.L. 115-97, section 11043, limited the deduction for mortgage interest paid on home equity loans and line of credit. For more information, see Pub. 936. Allocation period.The period for which a loan is allocated to a particular use begins on the date the proceeds are used and ends on the earlier of the following dates. The date the loan is repaid. The date the loan is reallocated to another use. Proceeds not disbursed to borrower.Even if the leader disburses the loan proceeds to a third party, the allocation of the loan is still based on your use of the funds. This applies whether you pay for property, services, or anything else by invorning a loan, or you take property subject to a debt. Proceeds deposited in borrower's account.Treat loan proceeds deposited in an account as property held for investment. It does not matter whether the account pays interest. Any interest you pay on the loan is investment interest expense. If you withdraw the proceeds of the loan, you must reallocate the loan based on the use of the funds. Celina, a calendar-year taxplayer, borrows $100,000 on January 4 and immediately uses the proceeds to open a checking account. No other amounts are deposited in the account during the year and no part of the loan principal is repaid during the year. On April 2, Celina uses $20,000 from the checking account for a passive activity expenditure. On September 4, Celina uses an additional $40,000 from the account for personal purposes. Under the interest allocation rules, the entire $100,000 loan is treated as property held for investment for the period from January 4 through April 1. From April 2 through September 3, Celina must treat $20,000 of the loan as used in the passive activity and $80,000 of the loan as property held for investment. From September 4 through December 31, the must treat $40,000 of the loan as used for personal purposes, $20,000 as used in the passive activity, and $40,000 as property held for investment. Order of funds spent.Generally, you treat loan proceeds deposited in an account as used (spend) before either of the following amounts. Any unborrowed amounts held in the same account. Any amounts deposited after these loan proceeds. Example.On January 9, 9, 9 and 9 are the only one-to-you withdrew it until you either repay it or real-cate it to another use is personal interest expense. The interest charged on the loan proceeds you left in the account (S867) continues to be investment interest expense until you either repay it or real-cate it to another use. **Loan repayment.** When you repay any part of a loan allocated to more than one use, treat it as being prepaid in the following order. 1. Personal use. 2. Investments and passive activities (other than those included in (3)). 3. Passive activities in connection with a rental real estate activity in which you actively participate. 4. Former passive activities. 5. Trade or business use and expenses for certain low-income housing projects. **Line of credit (continuous borrowings).** The following rules apply if you have a line of credit or similar arrangement. 1. Treat all borrowed funds on which interest accrues at the same fixed or variable rate as a single loan. 2. Treat borrowed funds or parts of borrowed funds on which interest accrues at different fixed or variable rates as different loans. Treat these loans as repaid in the order shown on the loan agreement. **Loan refinancing.** Allocate the replacement loan to the same uses to which the repaid loan was allocated. Make this allocation only to the extent you use the proceeds of the new loan to repay any part of the original loan. **Debt-financed distribution.** A debt-financed distribution occurs when a partnership or S corporation borrows funds and allocates those funds to distributions made to partners or shareholders. The manner in which you report the interest expense associated with the distributed debt proceeds depends on your use of those proceeds. _How to report._ If the proceeds were used in a nonpassive trade or business activity, report the interest on Schedule E (Form 1040), one 28; enter \"interest expense\" and the name of the partnership or S corporation in column (a) and the amount in column (i). If the proceeds were used in a passive activity, follow the instructions for Form 8582 to determine the amount of interest expense that can be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040), line 28; enter \"interest expense\" and the name of the partnership in column (a) and the amount in column (g). If the proceeds were used in an investment activity, enter the interest on Form 4952. If the proceeds are used for personal purposes, the interest is generally not deductible. If you receive a refund of interest you over-paid in an earlier year, this amount will be reported in how 44 of Form 1098. You cannot deduct this amount. For information on how to report this refund, see _Refunds.of interest_, later, in this chapter. _Expenses paid to obtain a mortgage._ Certain expenses you pay to obtain a mortgage cannot be deducted as interest. These expenses, which include mortgage commissions, abstract fees, and recording fees, are capital expenses. If the property mortgaged is business or income-producing property, you can amortize the costs over the life of the mortgage. _Prepayment penalty._ If you pay off your mortgage early and pay the lender a penalty for doing this, you can deduct the penalty as interest. **Interest on employment tax deficiency.** Interest charged on employment taxes assessed on your business is deductible. **Original issue discount (OID).** OID is a form of interest. A loan (mortgage or other debt) generally has OID when its proceeds are less than its principal amount. The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the loan. A loan's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts (principal and interest) payable on it other than qualified stated interest. Qualified stated interest is standardised that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than another loan of the issuser) at least annually over the term of the loan at a single fixed rate. You generally deduct OID over the term of the loan. Figure the amount to deduct each year using the constant-yield method, unless the OID on the loan is de minimis. _De minimis OID._ The OID is de minimis if it is less than one-fourth of 1% (0.0025) of the stated redemption price of the loan at maturity multiplied by the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity (the term of the loan). If the OID is de minimis, you can choose one of the following ways to figure the amount you can deduct each year. * On a constant-yield basis over the term of the loan. * On a straight-line basis over the term of the loan. * In proportion to stated interest payments. * In its entirety at maturity of the loan. You make this choice by deducting the OID in a manner consistent with the method chosen on your timely filed tax return for the tax year in which the loan is issued. _Example._ On January 1, 2022, you took out a $100,000 discounted loan and received $98,500 in proceeds. The loan will mature on January 1, 2032 (a 10-year term), and the $100,000 principal is payable on that date. Interest of $10,000 is payable on January 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 2023. The $1,500 OID on the loan is de minimis because it is less than $2,500 ($100,000 \\(\\times\\) 0.0025 \\(\\times\\) 10). You choose to deduct the OID on a straight-linebasis over the term of the loan. Beginning in 2022, you can deduct $150 each year for 10 years. _Constant-yield method._ If the OID is not de minimis, you must use the constant-yield method to figure how much you can deduct each year. You figure your deduction for the first year using the following steps. 1. Determine the issue price of the loan. Generally, this equals the proceeds of the loan. If you paid points on the loan (as discussed later), the issue price is generally the difference between the proceeds and the points. 2. Multiply the result in (1) by the yield to maturity. 3. Subtract any qualified stated interest payments from the result in (2). This is the OID you can deduct in the first year. To figure your deduction in any subsequent year, follow the steps above, except determine the adjusted issue price in step 1. To get the adjusted issue price, add to the issue price any OID previously deducted. Then follow steps 2 and 3 above. The yield to maturity is generally shown in the literature you receive from your lender. If you do not have this information, consult your tender or tax advisor. In general, the yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used in figuring the present value of all principal and interest payments, produces an amount equal to the principal amount of the loan. _Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you deduct the OID on a constant-yield basis over the term of the loan. The yield to maturity on your loan is 10.2467%, compound annually. For 2022, you can deduct $93 ($98,500 \\(\\times\\Interest you paid or incurred during the production period must be capitalized if the property produced is designated property. Designated property is any of the following. * Real property. * Tangible personal property with a class life of 20 years or more. * Tangible personal property with an estimated production period of more than 2 years. * Tangible personal property with an estimated production period of more than 1 year if the estimated cost of production is more than 8T million. **Property you produce.** You produce property if you construct, build, install, manufacture, develop, improve, create, raise, or grow it. Treat property produced for you under a contract as produced by you up to the amount you pay or incur for the property. **Carrying charges.** Carrying charges include taxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or to carry, transport, or install personal property. You can choose to capitalize carrying charges not subject to the uniform capitalization rules if they are otherwise deductible. For more information, see _matter_.\n",

Exception for loans to qualified continuing care facilities.The below-market interest rules do not apply to a loan owed by a qualified continuing care facility under a continuing care contract if the tender or lenders' spouse is age 62 or older by the end of the calendar year. A qualified continuing care facility is one or more facilities (excluding nursing homes) meeting the requirements listed below. 1. Designed to provide services under continuing care contracts (defined below). 2. Includes an independent living unit, and either an assisted living or nursing facility, or both. 3. Substantially all of the independent living unit residents are covered by continuing care contracts. A \"continuing care contract\" is a written contract between an individual and a qualified continuing care facility that includes all of the following conditions. 1. The individual or individual's spouse must be entitled to use the facility for the rest of their life or lives.\n",

      " ## 6. Generally, you can only deduct taxes in the year you pay them. This applies whether you use the cash method or an accrual method of accounting. Under an accrual method, you can deduct a tax before you pay it if you meet the exception for recurring items discussed under _Economic Performance_ in Pub. 538. You can also elect to atably accrue real estate taxes as discussed later under _Real Estate Taxes_. See also _Foreign income taxes_, discussed later. **Limitation on acceleration of accreval of taxes.** A taxing jurisdiction can require the use of a date for accreving taxes that is earlier than the date it originally required. However, if you use an accreval method, and can deduct the tax before you pay it, use the original accreval date for the year of change and all future years to determine when you can deduct the tax. _Example._ Your state imposes a tax on personal property used in a trade or business conducted in the state. This tax is assessed and becomes a len of July 1 (accreval date). In 2022, the state changed the assessment and alien dates from July 1, 2023, to December 31, 2022, for property tax year 2023. Use the original accreval date (July 1, 2023) to determine when you can deduct the tax. You must also use the July 1 accreval date for all future years to determine when you can deduct the tax. **Uniform capitalization rules.** Uniform capitalization rules apply to certain taxpayers who produce real property or tangible personal property for use in a trade or business or for sale to customers. They also apply to certain taxpayers who acquire property for resale. Under these rules, you either include certain costs in inventory or capitalize certain expenses related to the property, such as taxes. For more information, see chapter 1. **Carrying charges.** Carrying charges include taxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or to carry, transport, or install personal property. You can elect to capitalize carrying charges not subject to the uniform capitalization rules if they are otherwise deductible. For more information, see chapter 7. **Refunds of taxes.** If you receive a refund for any taxes you deducted in an earlier year, include the refund in income to the extent the deduction reduced your federal income tax in the earlier year. For more information, see _Recovery of amount deducted (tax benefit rule)_ in chapter 1. _You must include in income any inter-set you receive on tax refunds._ **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by U.S. citizens and residents.** Foreign income taxes paid by U.S. citizens and residents are generally treated as foreign income for purposes of determining their U.S. federal income tax liability. However, there are exceptions to this general rule. For example, foreign income taxes paid on dividends received from foreign corporations are generally included in gross income. For more information, see _Foreign income taxes,_ discussed later. **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by nonresident aliens with U.S. source income.** Nonresident aliens who have U.S. source income may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on that income. The amount of U.S. federal income tax owed depends on the type of income and the applicable treaty between the United States and the country where the nonresident alien is a resident. For more information, see _Withholding tax,_ discussed later. **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by nonresident aliens without U.S. source income.** Nonresident aliens who do not have U.S. source income may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on their worldwide income. The amount of U.S. federal income tax owed depends on the applicable treaty between the United States and the country where the nonresident alien is a resident. For more information, see _Withholding tax,_ discussed later. **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by foreign persons with U.S. source income.** Foreign persons who have U.S. source income may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on that income. The amount of U.S. federal income tax owed depends on the type of income and the applicable treaty between the United States and the country where the foreign person is a resident. For more information, see _Withholding tax,_ discussed later. **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by foreign persons without U.S. source income.** Foreign persons who do not have U.S. source income may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on their worldwide income. The amount of U.S. federal income tax owed depends on the applicable treaty between the United States and the country where the foreign person is a resident. For more information, see _Withholding tax,_ discussed later. **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by foreign trusts with U.S. source income.** Foreign trusts that have U.S. source income may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on that income. The amount of U.S. federal income tax owed depends on the type of income and the applicable treaty between the United States and the country where the foreign trust is located. For more information, see _Withholding tax,_ discussed later. **Tax treatment of foreign income taxes paid by foreign estates with U.S. source income.** Foreign estates that have U.S. source income may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on that income.

      " ## Income Taxes This section discusses federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes. **Federal income taxes.** You cannot deduct federal income taxes. **State and local income taxes.** A corporation or partnership can deduct state and local income taxes imposed on the corporation or partnership as business expenses. An individual can deduct state and local income taxes only as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), subject to limitations. The deduction is limited to $10,000 as a total of the following taxes. 1. State and local income taxes or general sales taxes. See the Schedule A (Form 1040) instructions. 2. State and local real estate taxes. See the Schedule A (Form 1040) instructions. See also _Real estate taxes_, earlier. 3. State and local personal property taxes. However, an individual can deduct a state tax on gross income (as distinguished from net income) directly attributable to a trade or business as a business expense. _Accural of contested income taxes_. If you use an accrual method, and you contest a state or local income tax liability, you must accrue and deduct any contested amount in the tax year in which the liability is finally determined. If additional state or local income taxes for a prior year are assessed in a later year, you can deduct the taxes in the year in which they were originally imposed (the prior year) if the tax liability is not contested. You cannot deduct them in the year in which the liability is finally determined. The filling of an income tax return is not considered a contest and, in the absence of an overt act of protest, you can deduct the tax in the prior year. Also, you can deduct any additional taxes in the prior year if you do not show some affirmative evidence of denial of the liability. However, if you consistently deduct additional assessments in the year they are paid or finally determined (including those for which there was no contest), you must continue to do so. You cannot take a deduction in the earlier year unless you receive permission to change your method of accounting. For more information on accounting methods, see _When Cam 1 Deduct an Expense in chapter 1_. If you contest a state or local tax liability, and you transfer money or other property as a provisional payment of the contested tax liability, you can accrue and deduct the amount of the contested tax liability for which you made the provisional payment in the year in which you made the payment, even though the liability is not determined until a later year. If any portion of the contested amount which was deducted in the year the provisional payment was made is later refunded when the contest is settled, you must include such portion in your gross income in the year the refund is re-ceived. Notwithstanding the exception that allows accrual and deduction of contested state or local income tax liability upon payment, current accrual and deduction is not allowed for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by a foreign country or possession of the United States. Forgen income taxes.Generally, you can take either a deduction or a credit for income taxes imposed on you by a foreign country or a U.S. possession, subject to limitations. However, an individual cannot take a deduction or credit for foreign income taxes paid on income that is exempt from U.S. tax under the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion. For information on these exclusions, see Pub. 54. For information on the foreign tax credit, see Pub. 54. For more information on self-employment tax, see Pub. 54. For more information on self-employment tax, see Pub. 334. Additional Medicare Tax.You may be required to pay Additional Medicare Tax on self-employment income. See Form 8959 and the instructions for Form 8959 for more information on the Additional Medicare Tax. Self-Employment Tax.You may be required to pay Self-Employment Tax on your earnings as a self-employed person. See Form 1040-SE and the instructions for Form 1040-SE for more information on the Self-Employment Tax. Tax Credits.There are several tax credits available to individuals and businesses.

      " ## Other Taxes The following are other taxes you can deduct if you incur them in the ordinary course of your trade or business. Excise taxes.Generally, you can deduct as a business expense all excise taxes that are ordinary and necessary expenses of carrying on your trade or business. However, see _Fluid taxes_, later. For more information on excise taxes, see Pub. 510. Franchise taxes.You can deduct corporate franchise taxes as a business expense. Fuel taxes.Generally, taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and other motor fuels that you use in your business are included as part of the cost of the fuel. Do not deduct these taxes as a separate item. You may be entitled to a credit or refund for federal excise tax you paid on fuels used for certain purposes. For more information, see Pub. 510. Occupational taxes.You can deduct as a business expense an occupational tax charged at a flat rate by a locality for the privilege of working or conducting a business in the locality. Personal property tax.You can deduct any tax imposed by a state or local government on personal property used in your trade or business. Sales tax.Any sales tax you pay on a service for your business, or on the purchase or use of property in your business is treated as part of the cost of the service or property. If the service or the cost or use of the property is a deductible business expense, you can deduct the tax as part of that service or cost. If the property is merchandise bought for resale, the sales tax is part of the cost of the merchandise. If the property is perpetuity, add the sales tax to the basis for depreciation. For more information on basis, see Pub. 551. Do not deduct state and local sales taxes imposed on the buyer that you must collect and pay over to the state or local government. Also, do not include these taxes in gross receipts or sales. Taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains, and annuities.These taxes are generally considered personal income taxes, not business expenses. See Chapter 2 for more information. Income taxes.If you have employees, you must withhold federal income taxes from their wages. You also need to file Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, for each employee. Payroll taxes.You must pay federal unemployment taxes on behalf of your employees who work in the United States. You also need to file Form UC-B, Unemployment Cost Report, quarterly. Self-employed individuals must pay self-employment taxes on their earnings. They also need to file Schedule C, Form 1040, Self-Employed Individual Tax Return. Use of cash.Using cash instead of checks or electronic payment methods can make it difficult to track your business transactions and keep accurate financial records. It can also increase the risk of theft or loss of cash. Therefore, we recommend using checks or electronic payment methods whenever possible. \n",

You can't deduct amounts credited to a reserve set up for self-insurance. This applies even if you can't get business insurance coverage for certain business risks. However, your actual losses may be deductible. See Pub. 547. 2. Loss of earnings. You can't deduct premiums for a policy that pays for lost earnings due to sickness or disability. However, see the discussion on overhead insurance, item (8), under _Deductible Premiums_, earlier. 3. Certain life insurance and annuities. 4. For contracts issued before June 9, 1997, you can't deduct the premiums on a life insurance policy covering you, an employee, or any person with a financial interest in your business if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy. You are included among possible beneficiaries of the policy if the policy owner is obligated to repay a loan from you using the proceeds of the policy. A person has a financial interest in your business if the person is an owner or part owner of the business or has lent money to the business. 5. For contracts issued after June 8, 1997, you generally can't deduct the premiums on any life insurance policy, endowment contract, or annuity contract if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary. The disallowance applies without regard to whom the policy covers. 6. Performers. If, as a partner in a partnership, you take out an insurance policy on your own life and name your partners as beneficiaries to induce them to retain their investments in the partnership, you are considered a beneficiary. You can't deduct the insurance premiums. 7. Insurance to secure a loan. If you take out a policy on your life or on the life of another person with a financial interest in your business to get or protect a business loan, you can't deduct the premiums as a business expense. Nor can you deduct the premiums as interest on business loans or as an expense of financing loans. In the event of death, the proceeds of the policy are generally not taxed as income even if they are used to liquidate the debt. 8. Overhead insurance. If you have an insurance policy that provides protection against loss of earnings due to sickness or disability, you can't deduct the premiums as a business expense. Instead, you must include the premiums in your wages and salaries when calculating federal income taxes. 9. Insurance to cover property damage caused by natural disasters. If you have an insurance policy that covers property damage caused by earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or other natural disasters, you can't deduct the premiums as a business expense. Instead, you must include the premiums in your wages and salaries when calculating federal income taxes. 10. Insurance to cover property damage caused by terrorist attacks. If you have an insurance policy that covers property damage caused by terrorist attacks, you can't deduct the premiums as a business expense. Instead, you must include the premiums in your wages and salaries when calculating federal income taxes.\n",

However, see the discussion on overhead insurance, item (8), under _Deductible Premiums_, earlier. 3. Certain life insurance and annuities. 4. For contracts issued before June 9, 1997, you can't deduct the premiums on a life insurance policy covering you, an employee, or any person with a financial interest in your business if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy. You are included among possible beneficiaries of the policy if the policy owner is obligated to repay a loan from you using the proceeds of the policy. A person has a financial interest in your business if the person is an owner or part owner of the business or has lent money to the business. 5. For contracts issued after June 8, 1997, you generally can't deduct the premiums on any life insurance policy, endowment contract, or annuity contract if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary. The disallowance applies without regard to whom the policy covers. 6. Performers.

If you take out a policy on your life or on the life of another person with a financial interest in your business to get or protect a business loan, you can't deduct the premiums as a business expense. Nor can you deduct the premiums as interest on business loans or as an expense of financing loans. In the event of death, the proceeds of the policy are generally not taxed as income even if they are used to liquidate the debt. 8. Overhead insurance. If you have an insurance policy that provides protection against loss of earnings due to sickness or disability, you can't deduct the premiums as a business expense. Instead, you must include the premiums in your wages and salaries when calculating federal income taxes. 9. Insurance to cover property damage caused by natural disasters.

      " ## 11110 Nondeductible Premiums You can't deduct premiums on the following kinds of insurance. 1. Self-insurance reserve funds. You can't deduct premiums for insurance amounts credited to a reserve set up for self-insurance. This applies even if you can't get business insurance coverage for certain business risks. However, your actual losses may be deductible. See Pub. 547. 2. Loss of earnings. You can't deduct premiums for a policy that pays for lost earnings due to sickness or disability. However, the discussion on overhead insurance, item (8), under _Deductible Premiums_, earlier. 3. Certain life insurance and annuities. 4. For contracts issued before June 9, 1997, you can't deduct the premiums on a life insurance policy covering you, an employee, or any person with a financial interest in your business if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy. You are included among possible beneficiaries of the policy if the policy owner is obligated to repay a loan from you using the proceeds of the policy. A person has a financial interest in your business if the person is an owner or part owner of the business or has lent money to the business. 5. For contracts issued after June 8, 1997, you generally can't deduct the premiums on any life insurance policy, endowment contract, or annuity contract if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary. The disallowance applies without regard to whom the policy covers. 6. Performers. If, as a partner in a partnership, you take out an insurance policy on your own life and name your partners as beneficiaries to induce them to retain their investments in the partnership, you are considered a beneficiary. You can't deduct the insurance premiums in the tax year you actually paid them, even if you incurred them in an earlier year. However, see _Pregayment_, later. Accrual method.If you use an accrual method of accounting, you can't deduct insurance premiums before the tax year in which you incur a liability for them. In addition, you can't deduct insurance premiums before the tax year in which you actually pay them (unless the exception for requiring terms applies). For more information about the accrual method of accounting, see _Chapter 1_. For information about the exception for recurring items, see Pub. 538. Prepayment.You can't deduct expenses in advance, even if you pay them in advance. This rule applies to any expense paid for enough in advance to, in effect, create an asset with a useful life extending substantially beyond the end of the current tax year. Expenses such as insurance are generally allocable to a period of time. You can deduct insurance expenses for the year to which they are allocable. Example.In 2022, you signed a 3-year insurance contract. Even though you paid the premiums for 2022, 2023, and 2024 when you signed the contract, you can only deduct the premium for 2022 on your 2022 tax return. You can deduct in 2023 and 2024 the premiums allocable to those years. Dividends received.If you receive dividends from business insurance and you deducted the premiums in prior years, at least part of the dividends are generally income. For more information, see _Recovery of amount deducted tax benefit table_ in chapter_1 under flow. Much Can1Docket_. Tax treatment of insurance policies.The tax treatment of insurance policies depends on the type of policy and how it is used. Generally, insurance policies provide protection against loss and are not treated as investment vehicles. Insurance policies do not produce income; instead, they reduce risk. For example, if you have a term life insurance policy, you don't need to report the death benefit as income. Instead, you can claim the death benefit as a credit toward taxes owed by your estate. However, some types of insurance policies provide income. These include annuity contracts and endowment contracts. An annuity contract provides a guaranteed income stream over a specified period of time. Endowment contracts provide both a guaranteed income stream and a cash value component. Insurance policies also affect your tax liabilities. For example, if you have a long-term care insurance policy, you can deduct premiums paid for medical expenses covered by the policy. Insurance policies also affect your capital gains tax liabilities. For example, if you sell a stock option that was granted under a qualified plan, you must recognize gain on the sale of the underlying stock. However, if you sell a stock option that was granted under a nonqualified plan, you don't have to recognize gain until you exercise the option. Insurance policies also affect your estate tax liabilities. For example, if you have a life insurance policy, you can leave the proceeds to your heirs without paying estate tax. However, if you transfer ownership of the policy to someone else, you may owe gift tax. Insurance policies also affect your retirement plans. For example, if you participate in a defined contribution plan, you can contribute pre-tax dollars to the plan. However, contributions made to a traditional IRA are subject to income taxation when withdrawn. Contributions made to a Roth IRA are not subject to income taxation when withdrawn. Insurance policies also affect your personal property. For example, if you have homeowners insurance, you can deduct premiums paid for damage caused by natural disasters. However, if you have a high net worth, you may not be able to deduct all of your premiums. Insurance policies also affect your tax planning strategies. For example, if you want to minimize your tax liability, you might consider purchasing a permanent life insurance policy. Permanent life insurance policies provide both a death benefit and a cash value component. As you age, you can borrow against the cash value component to fund other investments. Insurance policies also affect your tax compliance obligations. For example, if you have a group health insurance plan, you must comply with various reporting requirements. Failure to comply could result in penalties. Insurance policies also affect your tax audit procedures. For example, if you have a large number of insurance policies, auditors may require additional documentation to verify your deductions. Insurance policies also affect your tax treaty obligations. For example, if you live in a country with different tax laws than the United States, you may need to file foreign tax returns. Insurance policies also affect your tax planning opportunities. For example, if you have a large number of insurance policies, you may be eligible for special tax credits or deductions. Insurance policies also affect your tax planning strategies. For example, if you want to minimize your tax liability, you might consider purchasing a permanent life insurance policy. Permanent life insurance policies provide both a death benefit and a cash value component. As you age, you can borrow against the cash value component to fund other investments.

Certain carrying charges must be capitalized under the uniform capitalization rules. (For information on capitalization of interest, see chapter_4.) You can elect to capitalize carrying charges not subject to the uniform capitalization rules, but only if they are otherwise deductible. You can elect to capitalize carrying charges separately for each project you have and for each type of carrying charge. You election is good for only 1 year for unimproved and unproductive real property. You must decide whether to capitalize carrying charges each year the property remains unimproved and unproductive. For other real property, your election to capitalize carrying charges remains in effect until construction or development is completed. For personal property, your election is effective until the date you install or first use it, whichever is later. How to make the election.To make the election to capitalize a carrying charge, attach a statement to your original tax return for the year the election is to be effective indicating which charges you are electing to capitalize. However, if you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Attach the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-Z\" on the statement. File the amended return at the same address you filed the original return. If you fail to file the amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions), you cannot make the election. What happens if I don't make the election to capitalize a carrying charge? If you do not make the election to capitalize a carrying charge, you may be able to deduct the expense as a current business expense. However, this could result in higher self-employment taxes and lower net income. Additionally, if you sell the property in the future, any undeducted carrying charges will become part of the basis used to calculate capital gains tax.\n",

For more information, see Form 6765 and its instructions. **Payroll tax credit.** The payroll tax credit is an annual election made by a qualified small business specifying the amount of research credit, not to exceed S250,000, that may be used against the employer portion of social security liability. The credit is the smallest of the current year research credit, an elected amount not to exceed S250,000, or the general business credit carryforward for the tax year (before the application of the payroll tax credit election for the tax year). The election must be made on or before the due date of the originally filed return (including extensions). An election cannot be made for a tax year if an election was made for 5 or more preceding tax years. The election made by a partnership or S corporation is made at the entity level. A qualified small business that elects to claim the payroll tax credit will claim the payroll tax credit against the employer's portion of social security tax on its employment tax return for the first quarter that begins after it flies the return reflecting the payroll tax election. For more information, see the instructions for Form 6765. **General business credit carryforward.** If a qualified small business does not use all of its research credit during the tax year, it can carry forward the unused amount to future tax years. The maximum amount that may be carried forward is $3 million ($2 million for tax years beginning after January 1, 2012). To claim the general business credit carryforward, the taxpayer must file Form 8834, Credit for Increasing Research Activities, with its original return or extension. **Election to apply research credit to net income.** A qualified small business may choose to apply any remaining research credit to its net income instead of using it to reduce taxes. This election is made on Form 8834, Credit for Increasing Research Activities. **Research credit for foreign corporations.** Foreign corporations are eligible for the research credit under section 41(a)(1), but they do not receive a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their U.S. tax liability as a result of claiming the credit. Instead, the credit reduces the foreign corporation's foreign tax liability. Any excess credit is refundable to the foreign corporation. **Tax treatment of research credits claimed by individuals.** Individuals who claim the research credit under section 41(b) are treated as having earned wages subject to self-employment tax. However, these earnings are not included in determining the individual's adjusted gross income.\n",

However, you can elect to deduct intangible drilling costs (DCs) as a current business expense. These are certain drilling and development costs for wells in the United States in which you hold an operating or working interest. You can deduct only costs for drilling or preparing a well for the production of oil, gas, or geothermal steam or hot water. You can elect to deduct only the costs of items with no salvage value. These include wages, fuel, repairs, hailing, and supplies related to drilling wells and preparing them for production.

For geothermal wells, your election can be revoked by the filing of an amended return on which you do not take the deduction. You can file the amended return for the year up to the normal time of expiration for filing a claim for credit or refund, generally, within 3 years after the date you filed the original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. **Energy credit for costs of geothermal wells.** If you capitalize the drilling and development costs of geothermal wells that you place in service during the tax year, you may be able to claim a business energy credit. See the instructions for Form 3468 for more information. **Nonproductive well.** If you capitalize your IDCs, you have another option if the well is nonproductive. You can deduct the IDCs of the nonproductive well as an ordinary loss. You must indicate and clearly state your election on your tax return for the year the well is completed. Once made, the election for oil and gas wells is binding for all later years.

If you do not make this election, you can deduct the costs over the 10-year period beginning with the tax year in which you paid or incurred them. These rules do not apply to a nonproductive well. **Exchange of assets.** When you exchange assets, you recognize gain or loss only on the sale of the exchanged asset. This means that you do not recognize gain or loss when you acquire new assets in exchange for old ones. **Tax treatment of mining equipment.** Mining equipment used in the extraction of minerals is classified as personal property for federal income tax purposes.

However, you can elect to deduct up to $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately, $50 for a trust) of qualifying reforestation costs paid or incurred after October 22, 2004, for each qualified timber property. The remaining costs can be amortized over an 84-month period. For information about amortizing reforestation costs, see chapter.8. Qualifying reforestation costs are the direct costs of planting or seeding for forestation or reforestation. Qualified timber property is property that contains trees in significant commercial quantities. See chapter.8 for more information on qualifying reforestation costs and qualified timber property. If you elect to deduct qualified reforestation costs, create and maintain separate timber accounts for each qualified timber property and include all reforestation costs and the dates each was applied. Do not include this qualified timber property in any account (for example, depletion block) for which depletion is allowed. **How to make the election.** You elect to deduct qualifying reforestation costs by claiming the deduction on your timely filed income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year the expenses were paid or incurred. If Form 7 (Timber) is required, complete Part IV of the form. If Form 7 (Timber) is not required, attach a statement containing the following information for each qualified timber property for which an election is being made. * The unique stand identification numbers. * The total number of acres reforested during the tax year. * The nature of the reforestation treatments. * The total amounts of qualified reforestation expenditures eligible to be amortized or deducted. If you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Clearly indicate the election on your amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2.\" File the amended return at the same address you filed the original reforestation. The election applies when figuring taxable income for the current tax year and all subsequent years. For additional information on reforestation costs, see chapter 8. **Recapure.** This deduction may have to be re-captured as ordinary income under section 1245 when you sell or otherwise disposes of the property that would have received an addition to basis if you had not elected to deduct the expenditure. For more information on recapturing the deduction, see _Deprecation Recapture_ in Pub. 544.\n",

      " ## 7 Barrier Removal Costs The cost of an improvement to a business asset is normally a capital expense. However, you can elect to deduct the costs of making a facility or public transportation vehicle more accessible to and usable by those who are disabled or elderly. You must own or lease the facility or vehicle for use in connection with your trade or business. A facility is all or any part of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or similar real or personal property. A public transportation vehicle is a vehicle, such as a bus or railroad car, that provides transportation service to the public (including service for your customers, even if you are not in the business of providing transportation services). You cannot deduct any costs that you paid or incurred to completely renovate or build a facility or public transportation vehicle or to replace appreciable property in the normal course of business. **Deduction limit.** The most you can deduct as a cost of removing barriers to the disabled and the elderly for any tax year is $15,000. However, you can add any costs over this limit to the basis of the property and depreciate these excess costs. **Partners and partnerships.** The $15,000 limit applies to a partnership and also to each partner in the partnership. A partner can allocate the $15,000 limit in any manner among the partners's individually incurred costs and the partner's distributive share of partnership costs. If the partner cannot deduct the entire share of partnership costs, the partnership can add any costs not deducted to the basis of the improved property. A partnership must be able to show that any amount added to basis was not deducted by the partner and that it was over a partner's $15,000 limit (as determined by the partner). If the partnership cannot show this, it is presumed that the partner was able to deduct the distributivity share of the partnership's costs in full. **Example.** Emilio Azui's distributive share of ABC partnerships deductible expenses for the removal of architectural barriers was $14,000. Emilio had $12,000 of similar expenses in his sole propriatorship. He elected to deduct $7,000 of them. Emilio allocated the remaining $8,000 of the $15,000 limit to his share of ABC's expenses. Emilio can add the excess $5,000 of his own expenses to the basis of the property used in his business. Also, if ABC can show that Emilio could not deduct $6,000 ($14,000 - $8,000) of his share of the partnership's expenses because of how Emilio applied the limit, ABC can add $6,000 to the basis of its property. **Qualification standards.** You can deduct your costs as a current expense only if the barrier removal meets the guidelines and requirements issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. You can view the ADA at _ADA.gov/bubs/ ada.htm_. The following is a list of some architectural barrier removal costs that can be deducted. * Ground and floor surfaces. * Walks. * Parking lots. * Ramps. * Entrances. * Doors and doorways. * Stairs. * Floors. * Toilet rooms. * Water fountains. * Public telephones. * Elevators. * Controls. * Signage. * Airarms. * Protrutous objects. * Symbols of accessibility. You can find the ADA guidelines and requirements for architectural barrier removal at _USDQ.gov/tradecalendar/ada-calendar_\n",

      " #### A.5 Proof of the Claim To make the election to treat repairs and maintenance as capital expenditures, attach a statement titled \"Section 1.263(a)-3(n) Election\" to your timely filed returns (including extensions). **Qualifying costs.** A startup cost is amortizable if it meets both of the following tests. * It is a cost you could deduct if you paid or incurred it to operate an existing active trade or business (in the same field as the one you entered into). * It is a cost you pay or incur before the day your active trade or business begins. Startup costs include amounts paid for the following. * An analysis or survey of potential markets, products, labor supply, transportation facilities, etc. * Advertisements for the opening of the business. * Salaries and wages for employees who are being trained and their instructors. * Travel and other necessary costs for securing prospective distributors, suppliers, or customers. * Salaries and fees for executives and consultants, or for similar professional services. **Nonqualifying costs.** Startup costs don't include deductible interest, taxes, or research and experimental costs. See _Research and Experimental Costs_, later. **Purchasing an active trade or business.** Amortizable startup costs for purchasing an active trade or business include only investigative costs incurred in the course of a general search for or preliminary investigation of the business. These are costs that help you decide whether to purchase a business. Costs you incur in an attempt to purchase a specific business are capital expenses that you can't amortize. _Example._ On June 1, you hired an accounting firm and a law firm to assist you in the potential purchase of XYZ, Inc. They researched XYZ's industry and analyzed the financial projections of XYZ, Inc. In September, the law firm prepared and submitted a letter of intent to XYZ, Inc. The letter stated that a binding commitment would result only after a purchase agreement was signed. The law firm and accounting firm continued to provide services, including a review of XYZ's books and records and the preparation of a purchase agreement. On October 22, you signed a purchase agreement with XYZ, Inc. All amounts paid or incurred to investigate the business before October 22 are amortizable in investigative costs. Amounts paid on or after that date relate to the attempt to purchase the business and therefore must be capitalized. **Disposition of business.** If you completely dispose of your business before the end of the amortization period, you can deduct any remaining deferred startup costs. However, you can deduct these deferred startup costs only to the extent they qualify as a loss from a business. You cannot use them to offset income from another activity. **Electing to treat repairs and maintenance as capital expenditures.** To elect to treat repairs and maintenance as capital expenditures, attach a statement titled \"Section 1.263(a)-3(n) Election\" to your timely filed returns (including extensions). This election applies to all repairs and maintenance made during the year. **Qualifying repair and maintenance costs.** Qualifying repair and maintenance costs include amounts paid or incurred for repairs and maintenance performed on property used in a trade or business. These costs do not include amounts paid or incurred for repairs and maintenance performed on personal property. **Nonqualifying repair and maintenance costs.** Nonqualifying repair and maintenance costs include amounts paid or incurred for repairs and maintenance performed on property used in a trade or business if the repairs and maintenance are done by employees of the taxpayer. **Capitalizing repair and maintenance costs.** Capitalizing repair and maintenance costs means treating them as capital expenditures rather than deducting them immediately. **Deduction of repair and maintenance costs.** Deductions of repair and maintenance costs are allowed under Section 6701(g)(1), which provides that no deductions may be claimed for repairs and maintenance unless such repairs and maintenance are properly accounted for and charged against the property used in the taxpayer's trade or business. **Exceptions to the rule.** There are two exceptions to the rule that repairs and maintenance are capitalized when performed by employees of the taxpayer. First, repairs and maintenance performed on equipment used in agriculture are generally treated as deductible expenses. Second, repairs and maintenance performed on certain types of property used in a trade or business are also treated as deductible expenses. For example, repairs and maintenance performed on machinery used in manufacturing are generally treated as deductible expenses. **Tax treatment of repairs and maintenance performed by independent contractors.** Repairs and maintenance performed by independent contractors are generally treated as deductible expenses. However, there are some situations where repairs and maintenance performed by independent contractors may be capitalized. For example, if the repairs and maintenance are performed on property owned by the taxpayer but leased out to a third party, the repairs and maintenance may be capitalized. **Tax treatment of repairs and maintenance performed by employees.** Repairs and maintenance performed by employees of the taxpayer are generally capitalized. However, there are some situations where repairs and maintenance performed by employees may be deductible. For example, repairs and maintenance performed on property used in a trade or business if the repairs and maintenance are performed by nonemployees (i.e., independent contractors) are generally deductible. **Tax treatment of repairs and maintenance performed on personal property.** Repairs and maintenance performed on personal property are generally nondeductible expenses. However, there are some situations where repairs and maintenance performed on personal property may be deductible. For example, repairs and maintenance performed on personal property used for business purposes are generally deductible. **Tax treatment of repairs and maintenance performed on real estate.** Repairs and maintenance performed on real estate are generally nondeductible expenses. However, there are some situations where repairs and maintenance performed on real estate may be deductible. For example, repairs and maintenance performed on rental properties are generally deductible. **Tax treatment of repairs and maintenance performed on vehicles.** Repairs and maintenance performed on vehicles used in a trade or business are generally deductible expenses. However, there are some situations where repairs and maintenance performed on vehicles used in a trade or business may be capitalized.\n",

      " ## Section 197 Intangibles Defined The following assets are section 197 intangibles and must be amortized over 180 months. 1. Goodwill. 2. Going concern value. 3. Workforce in place. 4. Business books and records, operating systems, or any other information base, including lists or other information concerning current or prospective customers. 5. A patent, copyright, formula, process, design, pattern, know-how, format, or similar item. 6. A customer-based intangible. 7. A supplier-based intangible. 8. Any item similar to items 3 through 7. 9. A license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit or agency (including issuances and renewals). 10. A covenant not to compete entered into in connection with the acquisition of an interest in a trade or business. 11. Any franchise, trademark, or trade name. 12. A contract for the use of, or a term interest in, any item in this list. _You can't amortize any of the intangibles listed in items 1 through 8 that you created rather than acquired unless you created them in acquiring assets that make up a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business._ **Goodwill.** This is the value of a trade or business based on expected continued customer patronage due to its name, reputation, or any other factor. **Going concern value.** This is the additional value of a trade or business that attaches to property because the property is an integral part of an ongoing business activity. It includes value based on the ability of a business to continue to function and generate income even though there is a change in ownership (but doesn't include any other section 197 intangible). It also includes value based on the immediate use or availability of an acquired trade or business, such as the use of earnings during any period in which the business wouldn't otherwise be available or operational. **Workforce in place, etc.** This includes the composition of a workforce (for example, its experience, education, or training). It also includes the terms and conditions of employment, whether contractual or otherwise, and any other value placed on employees or any of their attributes. For example, you must amortize the part of the purchase price of a business that is for the existence of a highly skilled workforce. Also, you must amortize the cost of acquiring an existing employment contract or relationship with employees or consultants. **Business books and records, etc.** This includes the intangible value of technical manuals, training manuals or programs, data files, and accounting or inventory control systems. It also includes the cost of customer lists; subscription lists; insurance explanations; patient or client files; and lists of newspaper, magazine, radio, and television advertisers. **Patents, copyrights, etc.** This includes package design, computer software, and any interest in a film, sound recording, videotape, book, or other similar property, except as discussed later under _Assets That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles._ **Customer-based intangible.** This is the composition of market, market share, and any other value resulting from the future provision of goods or services because of relationships with customers in the ordinary course of business. For example, you must amortize the part of the purchase price of a business that is for the existence of the following intangibles. * A customer base. * A circulation base. * An undeveloped market or market growth. * Insurance in force. * A mortgage servicing contract. * An investment management contract. * Any other relationship with customers involving the future provision of goods or services. Accounts receivable or other similar rights to income for goods or services provided to customers before the acquisition of a trade or business aren't section 197 intangibles. **Supplier-based intangible.** A supplier-based intangible is the value resulting from the future acquisitions (through contract or other relationships with suppliers in the ordinary course of business) of goods or services that you will sell or use. The amount you pay or incur for supplier-based intangibles includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business that is attributable to the existence of a favorable relationship with persons providing distribution services (such as a favorable shelf of display space or a retail outlet), or the existence of favorable supply contracts. Don't include any amount required to be paid for the goods or services to honor the terms of the agreement or other relationship. Also, see _Asses That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles_, later. **Government-granted license, permit, etc.** This is any right granted by a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmential unit. For example, you must amortize the capitalized costs of acquiring (including issuing or renewing) a liquor license, a taxicab metallion or license, or a television or radio broadcasting license. **Covenant not to compete.** Section 197 intangibles include a covenant not to compete (or similar arrangement) entered into in connection with the acquisition of an interest in a trade or business, or a substantial portion of a trade or business. An interest in a trade or business includes an interest in a partnership or aporation engaged in a trade or business. An interest under either of the following. 1. An existing lease or sublease of tangible property. 2. A debt that was in existence when the interest was acquired. 3. A right to service residential mortgages unless the right is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business. 1. Certain transaction costs incurred by parties to a corporate organization or reorganization in which any part of a gain or loss isnt recognized. Intangible property that isn't amorizable under the rules for section 197 intangibles can be depreciated if it meets certain requirements. You must generally use the straight line method over its useful life. For certain intangibles, the depreciation period is specified in the law and regulations. For example, the depreciation period for computer software that isn't a section 197 intangible is generally 36 months. For more information on depreciating intangible property, see _Intangible Property_ under _What Method Can You Use To Depreciate Your Property?_ in chapter 1 of Pub. 946. **Contract for the use of, or a term interest in, a section 197 intangibles** **A section 197 intangibles include any right under a license, contract, or other arrangement providing for the use of any section 197 intangible. It also includes any term interest in any section 197 intangible, whether the interest is outright or in trust. **Assets That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles** The following assets aren't section 197 intangibles. 1. Any interest in a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate. 2. Any interest under an existing futures contract, foreign currency contract, notional principal contract, interest rate swap, or similar financial contract. 3. Any interest in land. 4. Most computer software. (See _Computer software_, later.) 5. Any of the following assets not acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business. 6. An interest in a film, sound recording, videotape, book, or similar property. 7. A right to receive tangible property or services under a contract or from a governmental agency. 8. An interest in a patent or copyright. 9. Certain rights that have a fixed duration or amount. (See _Bights of fixed duration or amount_, later.) 10. An interest under either of the following. 11. An existing lease or sublease of tangible property. 12. A debt that was in existence when the interest was acquired. 13. A right to service residential mortgages unless the right is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business. 14. Certain transaction costs incurred by parties to a corporate organization or reorganization in which any part of a gain or loss isnt recognized. Intangible property that isn't amorizable under the rules for section 197 intangibles can be depreciated if it meets certain requirements. You must generally use the straight line method over its useful life. For certain intangibles, the depreciation period is specified in the law and regulations. For example, the depreciation period for computer software that isn't a section 197 intangible is generally 36 months. For more information on depreciating intangible property, see _Intangible Property_ under _What Method Can You Use To Depreciate Your Property?_ in chapter 1 of Pub. 946. **Computer software.** Section 197 intangibles don't include the following types of computer software. 1. Software that meets all the following requirements. 1. It is, or has been, readily available for purchase by the general public. 2. It is subject to a nonexclusive license. 3. It hasn't been substantially modified. This requirement is considered met if the cost of all modifications isn't more than the greater of 25% of the price of the publicly available unmodified software or SS2,000. 2. Software that isn't acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business. 3. Software that is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business but is used primarily outside the United States. 4. Software that is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business but is used exclusively outside the United States. If you acquire computer software that does meet these criteria, you may be able to deduct the cost of the software immediately instead of having to amortize it over time. See _Deduction of Computer Software Costs_ under _Tax Deductions_ in chapter 1 of Pub. 946. 5. Software that is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business but is used exclusively within the United States. In this case, you must amortize the cost of the software over 180 months. If you dispose of the software before the end of the amortization period, you may be entitled to a credit equal to the excess of the original basis of the software over the amount you received for the sale. 6. Software that is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business but is used both inside and outside the United States. In this case, you must amortize the cost of the software over 180 months. If you dispose of the software before the end of the amortization period, you may be entitled to a credit equal to the excess of the original basis of the software over the amount you received for the sale.

      " ## Safe Harbor for Creative Property Costs If you are engaged in the trade or business of film production, you may be able to amortize the creative property costs for properties not set for production within 3 years of the first capitalized transaction. You may amortize these costs rationally over a 15-year period beginning on the first day of the second half of the tax year in which you properly write off the costs for financial accounting purposes. If, during the 15-year period, you dispose of the creative property rights, you must continue to amortize the costs over the remainder of the 15-year period. Creative property costs include costs paid or incurred to acquire and develop screenplays, scripts, story outlines, motion picture production rights to books and plays, and other similar properties for purposes of potential future film development, production, and exploitation. Amortize these costs using the rules of Revenue Procedure 2004-36. For more information, see Revenue Procedure 2004-36, 2004-24 I.R.B. 1063, available at _IRS.gov/lib/2004-24 I.R.B.#P-2004-36_.

Don't treat stock constructively owned by an individual under Rule 2 or 3 as owned by the individual for reapplying Rule 2 or 3 to make another person the constructive owner of the stock. Gain-recognition exception.This exception to the anti-churning rules applies if the person you acquired the intangible from (the transferor) meets both of the following requirements. * That person wouldn't be related to you (as described under _Related person_, earlier) if the 20% test for ownership of stock and partnership interests were replaced by a 50% test. * That person chose to recognize gain on the disposition of the intangible and pay income tax on the gain at the highest tax rate.

File Form 3115 to request a change to a permissible method of accounting for amortization. The following are examples of a change in method of accounting for amortization. * A change in the amortization method, period of recovery, or convention of an amortizable asset. * A change in the accounting for amortizable assets from a single asset account to a multiple asset account (pooling), or vice versa. * A change in the accounting for amortizable assets from one type of multiple asset account to a different type of multiple asset account. Changes in amortization that aren't a change in method of accounting include the following. * A change in figuring amortization in the tax year in which your use of the asset changes. * An adjustment in the useful life of an amortizable asset. * Generally, the making of a late amortization election or the revocation of a timely valid amortization election. * Any change in the placed-in-service date of an amortizable asset. See Regulations section 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(a) for more information and examples.

      " ## 15 Representation Costs You can elect to deduct a limited amount of reforestation costs paid or incurred during the tax year. See _Reforestation Costs_ in chapter 1.7_. You can elect to amortize the qualifying costs that aren't deducted currently over an 84-month period. There is no limit on the amount of your amortization deduction for reforestation costs paid or incurred during the tax year. The election to amortize reforestation costs incurred by a partnership, S Corporation, or estimate must be made by the partnership, copporation, or estate. A partner, shareholder, or beneficiary can't make that election. A partner's or shareholder's share of amorizable costs is figured under the general rules for allocating items of income, loss, deduction, etc., of a partnership or S Corporation. The amorizable costs of an estate are divided between the estate and the income beneficiary based on the income of the estate allocable to each. Qualifying costs.Reforestation costs are the direct costs of planting or seeding for forestation or reforestation. Qualifying costs include only those costs you must capitalize and include in the adjusted basis of the property. They include costs for the following items. * Site preparation. * Seeds or seedlings. * Labor. * Tools. * Depreciation on equipment used in planting and seeding. Qualifying costs don't include costs for which the government reimburses you under a cost-sharing program, unless you include the reimbursement in your income. Qualified timber property.Qualified timber property property is property that contains trees in significant commercial quantities. It can be a woodoid or other site but you own or lease. The property qualifies only if it meets all of the following requirements. * Its located in the United States. * It is held for the growing and cutting of timber you will use in, or self for use in, the commercial production of timber products. * It consists of at least one arc planted with tree seedlings in the manner normally used in forestation or reforestation. Qualified timber property doesn't include property on which you have planted shelter belts or ornamental trees, such as Christmas trees. Amortization period.The 84-month amortization period starts on the first day of the first month of the second half of the tax year you incur the costs (July 1 for a calendar year tax-paper), regardless of the month you actually incur the costs. You can claim amortization deductions for no more than 6 months of the first and last (github) tax years of the period. Life tenant and remainderan.If one person holds the property for life with the remainder going to another person, the life tenant is entitled to the full amortization for qualifying reforestation costs incurred by the life tenant. Any remainder interest in the property is ignored for amortization purposes. Recapure.If you dispose of qualified timber property within 10 years after the tax year you incur qualifying reforestation expenses, report any gain as ordinary income up to the amortization you took. See chapter 3 of Pub. 544 for more information. How to make the election.To elect to amortize qualifying reforestation costs, complete Part VI of Form 4562 and attach a statement that contains the following information. * A description of the costs and the dates you incur incurred them. * A description of the type of timber being grown and the purpose for which it is grown. Attach a separate statement for each property for which you amortize rotorestation costs. Generally, you must make the election on a timely filed return (including extensions) for the tax year in which you incurred the costs. However, if you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Attach Form 4562 and the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" on Form 4562. File the amended return at the same address you filed the original return. Revoking the election.You must get IRS approval to revoke your election to amortize qualifying reforestation costs. Your application to revoke the election must include your name, address, the years for which your election was in effect, and your reason for revoking it. Provided your daytime telephone number (optional), in case we need to contact you. You, or your duty authorized representative, must sign the application and file it at least 90 days before the due date (without extensions) for filing your income tax return for the first tax year for which your election is to end. The facility must not significantly increase the output or capacity, extend the useful life, or reduce the total operating costs of the plant or other property. Also, it must not significantly change the nature of the manufacturing or production process or facility. The federal certifying authority won't certify your property to the extent it appears you will recover (over the property's useful life) all or part of its cost from the profit based on its operation (such as through sales of recovered wastes). The federal certifying authority will describe the nature of the potential cost recovery. You must then reduce the amortizable basis of the facility by this potential recovery. New identifiable treatment facility.A new identifiable treatment facility is tangible de-preciable property that is identifiable as a treatment facility. It doesn't include a building and its structural components unless the building is exclusively a treatment facility. Atmospheric pollution control facilities.Certain atmospheric pollution control facilities can be amortized over 84 months. To qualify, the following must apply. * The facility must be acquired and placed in service after April 11, 2005. If acquired, the original use must begin with you after April 11, 2005. * The facility must be used in connection with an electric generation plant or other property placed in operation after December 31, 1975, that is primarily coal fired. * If you construct, reconstruct, or erect the facility, only the basis attributable to the construction, reconstruction, or excretion completed after April 11, 2005, qualifies. Basis reduction for corporations.A corporation must reduce the amortizable basis of a pollution control facility by 20% before figuring the amortization deduction. More information.For more information on the amortization of pollution control facilities, see sections 169 and 291(c) and the related regulations.  ## 16 Information Entropy  Information entropy is a measure of randomness or uncertainty in a message or system. It is defined as the average level of information produced per symbol in a message or system. This means that the higher the information entropy, the less predictable the message or system is.  In communication systems, information entropy plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of data transmission. When there is high information entropy in a message or system, it becomes difficult to transmit the message accurately, leading to errors and increased noise levels. On the other hand, when there is low information entropy, the message can be transmitted more efficiently, resulting in fewer errors and lower noise levels.  One way to improve the efficiency of data transmission is to compress the message or system. Compression involves reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while maintaining the integrity of the message. By reducing the information content of the message, compression algorithms can take advantage of the redundancy inherent in many messages, allowing for more efficient transmission.  Another important aspect of information entropy is its relationship to coding theory. Coding theory deals with the design of error-correcting codes that can detect and correct errors in transmitted messages. These codes rely on the properties of information entropy to determine the optimal code length and encoding scheme for a given message or system.  Overall, information entropy is a fundamental concept in modern communication systems, playing a critical role in determining the efficiency and reliability of data transmission.\n",

These distributions may be subject to income taxes.  ### 8.1 Traditional IRA  The amount of the required minimum distribution depends on your age and the balance in your account at the end of the previous tax year. You can choose to receive the distribution in cash or roll it over into another eligible plan.  If you fail to take the required minimum distribution, you may owe a penalty tax equal to 50% of the amount not distributed. This penalty tax does not apply if you are under age 59 ½ and meet certain conditions.  ### 8.2 Annuity  An annuity contract requires you to make a lump sum payment to the insurance company in exchange for guaranteed periodic payments for life or a specified term. The amount of the required minimum distribution depends on your age and the balance in your annuity account at the end of the previous tax year.  If you fail to take the required minimum distribution, you may owe a penalty tax equal to 50% of the amount not distributed. This penalty tax does not apply if you are under age 59 ½ and meet certain conditions.  ### 8.3 Qualified Plan  Qualified plans include defined benefit pension plans, such as the Civil Service Retirement System, and defined contribution plans, such as the Thrift Savings Plan. The amount of the required minimum distribution depends on your age and the balance in your account at the end of the previous tax year.  If you fail to take the required minimum distribution, you may owe a penalty tax equal to 50% of the amount not distributed. This penalty tax does not apply if you are under age 59 ½ and meet certain conditions.  It's important to note that the rules regarding required minimum distributions may change\n",

      " ### Figuring percentage depletion. Generally, as an independent producer or royalty owner, you figure your percentage depletion by figuring your average daily production of domestic oil or gas and comparing it to your depletable oil or gas quantity. If your average daily production does not exceed your depletable oil or gas quantity, you figure your percentage depletion by multiplying the gross income from the oil or gas property (as defined under _Gross income from the property_, later) by 15% (0.15). If your average daily production of domestic oil or gas exceeds your depletable oil or gas quantity, you must make an allocation as explained later under _Average daily production_. In addition, there is a limit on the percentage depletion deduction. See _Taxable income limit_, later. **Average daily production.** Figure your average daily production by dividing your total domestic production of oil or gas for the tax year by the number of days in your tax year. **Partial interest.** If you have a partial interest in the production from a property, figure your share of the production by multiplying total production from the property by your percentage participation in the revenues from the property. You have a partial interest in the production from a property if you have a net profits interest in the property. To figure the share of production for your net profits interest, you must first determine your percentage participation (as measured by the net profits) in the gross revenue from the property. To figure this percentage, you divide the income you receive for your net profits interest by the gross revenue from the property. Then multiply the total production from the property by your percentage participation to figure your share of the production. **Example.** Riley owns oil property in which Finley owns a 20% net profits interest. During the year, the property produced 10,000 barrels of oil, which Riley sold for $200,000. Riley had expenses of $90,000 attributable to the property. The property generated a net profit of $110,000 ($200,000 - $900,000). Finley received income of $22,000 ($110,000 \\(\\times\\) 20% (0.20)) as Finley's net profits interest. The percentage participation that Finley determined was 11%, figured by dividing $22,000 (income received) by $200,000 (the gross revenue from the property). Finley's share of the oil production was determined to be 1,100 barrels (10,000 barrels \\(\\times\\) 11% (0.11)). **Depitelable oil or natural gas quantity.** Generally, your depletable oil quantity is 1,000 barrels. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of your depletable oil quantity that you choose to apply. If you claim depletion on both oil and natural gas, you must reduce your depletable oil quantity (1,000 barrels) by the number of barrels you use to figure your depletable natural gas quantity. **Example.** You have both oil and natural gas production. To figure your depletable natural gas quantity, you choose to apply 360 barrels of your depletable oil quantity. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 2.16 million cubic feet of gas (360 \\(\\times\\) 6,000). You must reduce your depletable oil quantity to 640 barrels (1,000 - 360). If you have production from marginal walls, see section 613A(c)(6) to figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. See also Notice 2022-24, available at _HS.gov/info/2022-21 IRB_. **Business entities and family members.** You must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in proportion to each business entity's or family member's production of domestic oil or gas for the year. * Corporations, trusts, and states if 50% or more of the beneficial interest is owned by the same or related persons (considering only persons that own at least 5% of the beneficial interest). * You and your spouse and minor children. * A related person is anyone mentioned in the related persons discussion under _Nondeductible loss_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for purposes of this allocation, item (1) in that discussion includes only an individual, spouse, and their minor children. **Controlled group of corporations.** Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one taxpayer when figuring the depletable oil or natural gas quantity. They share the depletable quantity. A controlled group of corporations is defined in section 1563(a), except that, for this purpose, the stock ownership requirement is \"more than 50%\" rather than \"at least 80%,\" as described in section 1563(a). **Gross income from the property.** For purposes of percentage depletion, gross income from the property (in the case of oil and gas wells) is the amount you receive from the sale of the oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well. If you do not sell the oil or gas on the property but manufacture or convert it into a refined product before sale, or transport it before sale, the gross income from the property is the representative market or field price (RMPP) of the oil or gas before conversion or transportation. However, if you sold gas after you transported it from the premises for a price that is lower than the RMPP, determine gross income from the property for percentage depletion purposes without regard to the RMPP. Gross income from the property does not include lease bonuses, advance royalties, or other amounts payable without regard to production from the property. **Average daily production exceeds depletable quantities. If your average daily production for the year is more than your depletable oil or natural gas quantity, figure your allowance for depletion for each domestic oil or natural gas property as follows.** 1. **Figure your average daily production of oil or natural gas for the year.** 2. **Figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. To figure your depletable natural gas quantity, you choose to apply 360 barrels of your depletable oil quantity. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 2.16 million cubic feet of gas (360 \\(\\times\\) 6,000). You must reduce your depletable oil quantity to 640 barrels (1,000 - 360).** If you have production from marginal walls, see section 613A(c)(6) to figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. See also Notice 2022-24, available at _HS.gov/info/2022-21 IRB_. **Business entities and family members.** You must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in proportion to each business entity's or family member's production of domestic oil or gas for the year. * Corporations, trusts, and states if 50% or more of the beneficial interest is owned by the same or related persons (considering only persons that own at least 5% of the beneficial interest). * You and your spouse and minor children. * A related person is anyone mentioned in the related persons discussion under _Nondeductible loss_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for purposes of this allocation, item (1) in that discussion includes only an individual, spouse, and their minor children. **Controlled group of corporations.** Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one taxpayer when figuring the depletable oil or natural gas quantity. They share the depletable quantity. A controlled group of corporations is defined in section 1563(a), except that, for this purpose, the stock ownership requirement is \"more than 50%\" rather than \"at least 80%,\" as described in section 1563(a). **Gross income from the property.** For purposes of percentage depletion, gross income from the property (in the case of oil and gas wells) is the amount you receive from the sale of the oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well. If you do not sell the oil or gas on the property but manufacture or convert it into a refined product before sale, or transport it before sale, the gross income from the property is the representative market or field price (RMPP) of the oil or gas before conversion or transportation. However, if you sold gas after you transported it from the premises for a price that is lower than the RMPP, determine gross income from the property for percentage depletion purposes without regard to the RMPP. **Partner's or shareholder's adjusted basis.** The partnership or S corporation must allocate to each partner or shareholder its share of the adjusted basis of each oil or gas property held by the partnership or S corporation. The partnership or S corporation makes the allocation as of the date it acquires the oil or gas property. Each member's share of the adjusted basis of the oil or gas property is generally figured according to that partner's interest in partnership capital. However, in some cases, it is figured according to the partner's interest in partnership income. The partnership or S corporation adjusts the partners or shareholder's share of the adjusted basis of the oil and gas property for any capital expenditures made for the property and for any change in partnership or S corporation interests. **Recordkeeping.** Each partner or shareholder must separately keep records of its share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the partnership or S corporation. The partner or shareholder must reduce its applicable adjusted basis by the depletion allowed or allowable on the property each year. The partner or shareholder must use that reduced adjusted basis to figure cost depletion, or its gain or loss, if the partnership or S corporation disposes of the property. **Reporting the deduction.** Information that you, as a partner or shareholder, use to figure your depletion deduction on oil and gas properties is reported by the partnership or S corporation on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or on Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S). Deduct oil and gas depletion for your partnership or S Corporation interest on Schedule E (Form 1040). The depletion conducted on Schedule E is included in figuring income or loss from rental real estate or royalty properties. The instructions for Schedule E (Form 1040) explain where to report this income or loss and whether you need to file either of the following forms. * Form 6198. * Form 8582. **Deductions limited by taxable income.** The percentage depletion deductions allowed for oil and gas properties cannot exceed your taxable income from all sources. Any excess deductions are carried forward to future years until used up. **Exceptions.** There are two exceptions to the rule that percentage depletion deductions cannot exceed taxable income. * If you have losses from nondepreciating activities, such as salaries paid to employees, you can offset these losses against the percentage depletion deductions allowed for oil and gas properties. * If you have gains from nondepreciating activities, such as sales of securities, you can offset these gains against the percentage depletion deductions allowed for oil and gas properties. **Taxable income limit.** The percentage depletion deductions allowed for oil and gas properties are subject to certain limits. These limits help ensure that the deductions do not become too large relative to your taxable income. * The maximum percentage depletion deduction allowed for oil and gas properties is 75%. This means that you can deduct no more than 75% of your gross income from the property. * If you have multiple oil and gas properties, you may be able to combine them for purposes of calculating the percentage depletion deduction. However, you must meet certain requirements to do so. * If you have oil and gas properties with different depletion rates, you may be able to combine them for purposes of calculating the percentage depletion deduction. However, you must meet certain requirements to do so. * If you have oil and gas properties with different depletion rates, you may be able to combine them for purposes of calculating the percentage depletion deduction.

      " ### Fiquing percentage depletion In the case of mines, wells, and other natural deposits other than gas, oil, or geothermal property, you may use the percentage rates discussed earlier under _Mines and Geothermal Deposits_. Any bonus or advanced royalty payments are generally part of the gross income from the property to which the rates are applied in making the calculation. However, for oil, gas, or geothermal property, gross income does not include lease pronuses, advanced royalties, or other amounts payable without regard to production from the property. _Ending the lease._ If you receive a bonus on a lease that ends or is abandoned before you derive any income from mineral extraction or the cutting of timber, include in income the depletion deduction you took on the bonus. Do this for the year the lease ends or is abandoned. Also, increase your adjusted basis in the property to restore the depletion deduction you previously subtracted. For advanced royalties, include in income the depletion claimed on minerals or timber for which the advanced royalties were paid, if the minerals were not produced or timber not cut before the lease ended. Include this amount in income for the year the lease ends. Increase your adjusted basis in the property by the amount you include in income. **Delay rentals.** These are payments for deferring development of the property. Since delay rentals are ordinary rentals are ordinary rentals we are ordinary income to the paye that is not subject to depletion. These rentals can be avoided by either abandoning the lease, beginning development operations, or obtaining production. _Development costs._ Development costs are expenses incurred in developing the property. They are capitalized at the end of the accounting period. The cost of drilling a new well, building a mine, or clearing land for timber cutting is an example of a development cost. _Depreciation._ Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of long-term assets over their useful lives. It is used to account for the gradual decline in value of these assets as they wear out. For mining properties, depreciation is calculated using the straight line method. For oil and gas properties, depreciation is calculated using the declining balance method. _Bonus._ A bonus is a payment made up front by the lessee to the lessor for the right to extract minerals or timber from the property. Bonuses are treated as prepaid expenses and are included in the initial investment. _Advanced royalties._ Advanced royalties are payments made in advance by the lessee to the lessor for future royalties. These payments are treated as prepaid expenses and are included in the initial investment. _Lease bonuses._ Lease bonuses are payments made up front by the lessee to the lessor for the right to extract minerals or timber from the property. Lease bonuses are treated as prepaid expenses and are included in the initial investment. _Royalty._ A royalty is a share of the revenue received from the sale of minerals or timber extracted from the property. Royalties are taxed as ordinary income. _Production._ Production is the quantity of minerals or timber extracted from the property during the accounting period. _Adjusted basis._ Adjusted basis is the original cost of the property plus all additions, such as improvements, and minus all deductions, such as depletion. _Gross income._ Gross income is the total revenue received from the sale of minerals or timber extracted from the property during the accounting period. _Net income._ Net income is gross income minus all deductions, including depletion. _Taxes._ Taxes are levied on net income.\n",

      " ## 4 Timber You can figure timber depletion only by the cost method. Percentage depletion does not apply to timber. Base your depletion on your cost or other basis in the timber. Your cost does not include the cost of land or any amounts recoverable through depreciation. Depletion takes place when you cut standing timber. You can figure your depletion deduction when the quantity of cut timber is first accurately measured in the process of exploitation. **Figuring cost depletion.** To figure your cost depletion allowance, you multiply the number of timber units cut by your depletion unit. _Timber units._ When you acquire timber property, you must make an estimate of the quantity of marketable timber reasonably known, or on good evidence believed to exist on the property. You measure the timber using feet board measure (FBM), log scale, cords, or other units. If you later determine that you have more or less units of timber, you must adjust the original estimate. The term \"timber property\" means your economic interest in standing timber in each tract or block representing a separate timber account. _Depletion unit._ You figure your depletion unit each year by taking the following steps. 1. Determine your cost or adjusted basis of the timber on hand at the beginning of the year. Adjusted basis is defined under _Cost Depletion_ in the discussion on _Mineral Property_, earlier. 2. Add to the amount determined in (1) the cost of any timber units acquired during the year and any additions to capital. 3. Figure the number of timber units to take into account by adding the number of timber units acquired during the year to the number of timber units on hand in the account at the beginning of the year and then adding (or subtracting) any correction to the estimate of the number of timber units remaining in the account. 4. Divide the result of (2) by the result of (3). This is your depletion unit. _Example._ You bought a timber tract for $160,000 and the land was worth as much as the timber. Your basis for the timber is $80,000. Based on an estimated 1 million feet board measure (FBM) or 1,000 \"thousand board feet\" (MFBM) of standing timber, you figure your depletion unit to be $80 per MFBM ($80,000 + 1,000). If you cut 500 MFBM of timber, your depletion allowance would be $40,000 (500 \\(\\mathrm{MFBM}\\times\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{0}\\)). **When to claim depletion.** Claim your depletion allowance as a deduction in the year of sale or other disposition of the products cut from the timber, unless you choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange (explained below). Include allowable depletion for timber products not sold during the tax year the timber is cut as a cost item in the closing inventory of timber products for the year. The inventory is your basis for determining gain or loss in the tax year you sell the timber products. _Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you seldom only half of the timber products in the cutting year. You would deduct $20,000 of the $40,000 depletion that year. You would add the remaining $20,000 depletion to your closing inventory of timber products. **Electing to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange.** You can elect, under certain circumstances, to treat the cutting of timber held for more than 1 year as a sale or exchange. You must make the election on your income tax return for the tax year to which it applies. The election can't be made on an amended return. If you make this election, subtract the adjusted basis for depletion from the fair market value (FBM) of the timber on the first day of the tax year in which you cut it to figure the gain or loss on the cutting. You generally report the gain as long-term capital gain. The FBM then becomes your basis for figuring your ordinary gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of the products cut from the timber. For more information, see _Timber_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544. You may revoke an election to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, without the IRS's consent, by the due (including extensions) for the return. The prior election (and revocation) is disregarded for purposes of making a subsequent election. See Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule) for more information. **Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule).** Complete and attach Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule) to your income tax return if you claim a deduction for timber depletion, choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, or make an outright sale of timber. Form T provides instructions for completing the form and calculating the depletion allowance. _Note._ Form T is available from the IRS website (www.irs.gov) or from local IRS offices.  ## 5 Mineral Properties  ### Cost Method  You can figure mineral depletion only by the cost method. Percentage depletion does not apply to minerals. Base your depletion on your cost or other basis in the mineral. Your cost does not include the cost of land or any amounts recoverable through depreciation.  Depletion takes place when you extract the mineral. You can figure your depletion deduction when the quantity of extracted mineral is first accurately measured in the process of exploitation.  To figure your cost depletion allowance, you multiply the number of mineral units extracted by your depletion unit.  _Mineral units._ When you acquire mineral property, you must make an estimate of the quantity of economically recoverable mineral reasonably known, or on good evidence believed to exist on the property. You measure the mineral using short tons, metric tons, pounds, or other units. If you later determine that you have more or less units of mineral, you must adjust the original estimate.  The term \"mineral property\" means your economic interest in standing mineral resources in each tract or block representing a separate mineral account.  _Depletion unit._ You figure your depletion unit each year by taking the following steps.  1. Determine your cost or adjusted basis of the mineral on hand at the beginning of the year. Adjusted basis is defined under _Cost Depletion_ in the discussion on _Mineral Property,_ earlier. 2. Add to the amount determined in (1) the cost of any mineral units acquired during the year and any additions to capital. 3. Figure the number of mineral units to take into account by adding the number of mineral units acquired during the year to the number of mineral units on hand in the account at the beginning of the year and then adding (or subtracting) any correction to the estimate of the number of mineral units remaining in the account. 4. Divide the result of (2) by the result of (3). This is your depletion unit. _Example._ You bought a mineral tract for $160,000 and the land was worth as much as the mineral. Your basis for the mineral is $80,000. Based on an estimated 100,000 short tons of economically recoverable mineral, you figure your depletion unit to be $80 per ton ($80,000 + 100,000). If you extract 50,000 tons of mineral, your depletion allowance would be $40,000 (50,000 tons x SSS0).  **When to claim depletion.** Claim your depletion allowance as a deduction in the year of sale or other disposition of the products extracted from the mineral, unless you choose to treat the extraction of mineral as a sale or exchange (explained below). Include allowable depletion for mineral products not sold during the tax year the mineral is extracted as a cost item in the closing inventory of mineral products for the year. The inventory is your basis for determining gain or loss in the tax year you sell the mineral products.  _Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you seldom only half of the mineral products in the extraction year. You would deduct $20,00\n",

      " ### Introduction You have a bad debt if you cannot collect money owed to you. A bad debt is either a business bad debt or a nonbusiness bad debt. This chapter discusses only business bad debts. Generally, a business bad debt is one that comes from operating your trade or business. You can deduct business bad debts on Scheduled C (Form 1040) or your applicable business income tax return. All other bad debts are nonbusiness bad debts and are deductible only as short-term capital losses. For more information on nonbusiness bad debts, see Pub. 550.\n",

      " ## When a Debt Becomes Worthless A debt becomes worthless when there is no longer any chance the amount owed will be paid. This may occur on the date the debt is due or prior to that date. To demonstrate worthlessness, you must only show that you have taken reasonable steps to collect the debt but were unable to do so. It isn't necessary to go to court if you can show that a judgment from the court would be uncollectible. Bankruptcy of your debtor is generally good evidence of the worthlessness of at least a part of an unsecured and unpreferred debt. **Property received for debt.** If you receive property in partial settlement of a debt, reduce the debt by the property's fMV, which becomes the property's basis. You can deduct the remaining debt as a bad debt if and when it becomes worthless. If you later sell the property for more than its basis, any gain on the sale is due to the appreciation of the property. It isn't a recovery of a bad debt. For information on the sale of an asset, see Pub. 544. **Debts secured with real estate.** If you take possession of a property under a security agreement, you are considered the owner of the property until the debt is satisfied. The property is subject to foreclosure if the debtor fails to pay the debt. Foreclosure is the legal process by which the lender takes ownership of the property because the borrower has defaulted on the loan. **Debts secured with personal property.** If you take possession of personal property under a security agreement, you are not considered the owner of the property unless the debtor defaults on the debt. If the debtor defaults, you become the owner of the property. However, you cannot use the property as collateral for another loan without the consent of the original creditor. **Unpaid wages and salaries.** Unpaid wages and salaries are not considered worthless until they become past-due. Once they become past-due, they are considered worthless.\n",

      " ## Specific Charge-off Method If you use the specific charge-off method, you can deduct specific business bad debts that become partly or totally worthless during the tax year. However, with respect to partly worthless bad debts, your deduction is limited to the amount you charged off on your books during the year. **Partly worthless debts.** You can deduct specific bad debts that become partly undecollective during the tax year. Your tax deduction is limited to the amount you charge off on your books during the year. You don't have to charge off and deduct your partly worthless debts annually. You can delay the charge-off until a later year. However, you can't deduct any part of a debt after the year it becomes totally worthless. _Significantly modified debt._ An exception to the charge-off rule exists for debt that has been significantly modified and on which the holder recognized gain. For more information, see Regulations section 1.166-3(a)(3). _Deduction disallowed._ Generally, you can claim a partial bad debt deduction only in the year you make the charge-off on your books. If, under audit, the IRS doesn't allow your deduction and the debt becomes partly worthless in a later tax year, you can deduct the amount you charged off in that year plus the disallowed amount charged off in the earlier year. The charge-off in the earlier year, unless reversed on your books, fulfills the charge-off requirement for the later year. **Totally worthless debts.** If a debt becomes totally worthless in the current tax year, you can deduct the entire amount minus any amount deducted in an earlier tax year when the debt was only partly worthless. You don't have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don't and the IRS later are about deduct that did not reduce your tax. Report the _recovery_ as \"Other income\" on the appropriate business form or schedule. _See Recoveries_ in Pub. 525 for more information. _NOL carryover._ If a bad debt deduction increases an NOL carryover that has not expired before the beginning of the tax year in which the recovery takes place, you treat the deduction as having reduced your tax. A bad debt deduction that contributes to an NOL helps lower taxes in the year to which you carry the NOL. For more information about NOLs for individuals, see Pub. 536. Also, see the instructions for Form 1045, and the instructions for Form 1139. _Bad debt deduction and loss carryforwards_.

      " ## Reminders **No miscellaneous itemized deductions allowed.** You can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions, including the deduction for repayments (claim of right). Miscellaneous itemized deductions are those deductions that would have been subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limitation. **Qualified business income deduction.** For tax years beginning after 2017, individual tax papers and some trusts and estates may be entitled to a deduction of up to 20% of their qualified business income (QBI) from a trade or business, including income from a pass-through entity, but not from a C Corporation, plus 20% of qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income. The deduction is subject to multiple limitations, such as the type of trade or business, the taxpayer's taxable income, the amount of W-2 wages paid in the trade or business, and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property held by the trade or business. The deduction can be taken in addition to the standard or itemized deductions. See the instructions for Form 8995 and the instructions for Form 8995-A for more information.\n",

      " ### Reasonable period of time. A reasonable period of time depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time. 1. You give an advance within 30 days of the time the employee pays or incurs the expense. 2. Your employees adequately account for their expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 3. Your employees return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 4. You give a periodic statement (at least quarterly) to your employees that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances _and_ they comply within 120 days of the date of the statement. How to deduct You can claim a deduction for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses if you reinfunwise your employees for these expenses under an accountable plan. Generally, the amount you can deduct for non-entertainment-related meals subject to a 50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole proprieter, or are filing as a single member limited liability company, deduct the travel reimbursement on line 24a and the deductible part of the non-entertainment-related meals reimbursement on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040). If you are filing an income tax return for a corporation, include the reimbursement on the _Other deductions_ line of Form 1120. If you are filling any other business income tax return, such as a partnership or S corporation return, deduct the reimbursement on the appropriate line of the return as provided in the instructions for that return. What is information entropy? Information entropy is a measure of randomness or uncertainty in a system. It was introduced by Claude E. Shannon in his paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" in 1948. The concept of information entropy has since become fundamental to modern information theory and computer science.\n",

Your employees must adequately account to you for their travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. They must give you documentary evidence of their travel, mileage, and other employee business expenses. This evidence should include items such as receipts, along with either a statement of expenses, an account book, a day planner, or similar record in which the employee entered each expense at or near the time the expense was incurred. The evidence should be kept by your employees for at least one year after the date of the expense.

An excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you pay to an employee that is more than the business-related expenses for which the employee adequately accounted. The employee must return any excess reimbursement or other expense allowance to you within a reasonable period of time. If the employee fails to do so, you may have to treat it as taxable income and report it on your Form W-2.                         What happens if an employee fails to return excess reimbursement or allowance?   \n",

These costs are a part of your investment in your business and are called 'capital expenses.' Capital expenses are considered assets in your business. In general, you capitalize three types of costs. * Business startup costs (see _Tip_ below). * Business assets. * Improvements. You can elect to deduct or amortize certain business startup costs. See chapters 7 and 8.                                What are the three types of costs that businesses typically capitalize?   \n",
       "2                                    ### Cost recovery Although you generally cannot take a current deduction for a capital expense, you may be able to recover the amount you spend through deprecation, amortization, or depletion. These recovery methods allow you to deduct part of your cost each year. In this way, you are able to recover your capital expense. See _Amortization_ (chapter 8) and _Dealization_ (chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can elect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction. A greater portion of these costs can be deducted if the property is qualified disaster assistance property. See Pub. 946 for details.

These costs may include expenses for advertising, travel, or wages for training employees. Capital expenses can be financed through loans from banks or other financial institutions.

Usually, you recover costs for a particular asset through depreciation. Generally, you cannot recover other costs until you sell the business or otherwise go out of business. However, you can choose to amortize certain costs for setting up your business. See _Starting a Business in chapter 8_ for more information on business startup costs.                                   What should be treated as capital expenses when starting a business?   \n",

       "115  ### Reimbursers A \"reimbursement or allowance arrangement\" provides for payment of advances, reimbursments, and allowances for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses incurred by your employees during the ordinary course of business. If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records. For example, you can deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. However, only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction.                                                      What is a reimbursement or allowance arrangement?   \n",

Your employees must adequately account to you for their travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. They must give you documentary evidence of their travel, mileage, and other employee business expenses. This evidence should include items such as receipts, along with either a statement of expenses, an account book, a day planner, or similar record in which the employee entered each expense at or near the time the expense was incurred. The evidence should be kept by your employees for at least one year after the date of the expense.

An excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you pay to an employee that is more than the business-related expenses for which the employee adequately accounted. The employee must return any excess reimbursement or other expense allowance to you within a reasonable period of time. If the employee fails to do so, you may have to treat it as taxable income and report it on your Form W-2.
