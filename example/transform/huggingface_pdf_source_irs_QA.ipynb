    "### Before running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to `uniflow` conda environment to run this notebook. You can set up the environment following the instruction: https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to run the code. Once you have the key, set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` within a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository. For more details, see this [instruction](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#api-keys)\n",

The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction.\\n**The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_.\\n**The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_.\\n**Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_.\\n**The IRS has issued guidance on how to report virtual currency transactions.** Virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, are digital assets used as a medium of exchange, store of value, or unit of account. These virtual currencies may be subject to federal income tax treatment as property. The IRS has issued guidance on how to report virtual currency transactions, including purchases, sales, exchanges, and transfers, in Form 1099-K, which must be filed by businesses that accept virtual currencies as payment. Additionally, businesses that accept virtual currencies as payment must keep records of all virtual currency transactions and provide this information to customers at the time of purchase.

It offers tips and resources on a variety of topics including:\\n* Filing requirements;\\n* Making quarterly estimated income tax payments;\\n* Paying self-employment taxes;\\n* Paying FICA, Medicare, and Additional Medicare taxes;\\n* Deductible business expenses; and\\n* Special rules for reporting vacation home rentals.\\nFor more information, go to the Gig Economy Tax Center at _IRS.gov/Gig_.\\n**Photographs of missing children.** The Internal Revenue Service is a product partner with the _National Center for Missing & Excluded Children(NCMEC)_.

You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-7HE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) if you recognize a child.\\n**Preventing slavery and human trafficking.** Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery, and involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to exploit human beings for some type of labor or commercial sex purpose. The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children, both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, who are subjected to the injustices of slavery and human trafficking, including forced labor, debt bondage, involuntary servitude, \"mail-order\" marranges, and sex trafficking. Trafficking in persons can occur in both lawful and illicit industries or markets, including in hotel services, hospitality, agriculture, manufacturing, jainitorial services, construction, health and elder care, domestic service, brothels, massage patders, and street prostitution, among others.\\nThe President\\'s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITE) brings together federal departments and agencies to ensure a whole-of-government approach that addresses all aspects of human trafficking. Online resources for recognizing and reporting trafficking activities, and assisting victims include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Blue Campaign at _DHS.gov/blue-camagna_, the Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at _State.gov/Gig_, and the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) at _humanat_af_fikish_ng_hotline.org. DHS is responsible for investigating human trafficking, arresting traffickers, and protecting victims. DHS also provides _imimization_._ leaflet to non-U.S. citizen victims of human trafficking. DHS uses a _actitioned approach_ to combine human trafficking, which places equal value on identifying and stabilizing victims and on investigating and prosecutions, each case and every conviction changes lives. DHS understands how difficult it can be for victims to come forward and work with law enforcement due to their trauma. DHS is committed to helping victims feel stable, safe, and secure.\\nTo report suspected human trafficking, call the DHS domestic 24-hour toll-free number at 866-DRS-2-ICE (866-347-2423) or 802-872-6199 (non-toll-free international). For help from the NHTRC, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline toll free at 888-373-7888 or 8recipts of $27 million or less for the 3 prior tax years, and (D) are not at a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3)).

If your business (or predecessor entity) had short tax years for any of the 3-tax-year period, annualize your business\\' gross receipts for the short tax years that are part of the 3-tax-year period.

These recovery methods allow you to deduct part of your cost each year. In this way, you are able to recover your capital expense. See _Amortization_ (chapter 8) and _Dealization_ (chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can elect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction. A greater portion of these costs can be deducted if the property is qualified disaster assistance property. See Pub. 946 for details.\\nquestion: Question 1: When can a taxpayer not take a current deduction for a capital expense?; Question 2: How does a taxpayer recover their capital expense over time?; Question 3: Can a taxpayer choose to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: You generally cannot take a current deduction for a capital expense.; Answer 2: Through deprecation, amortization, or depletion.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Business Assets\\nThere are many different kinds of business assets, for example, land, buildings, machinery, furniture, trucks, patents, and franchise rights. You must fully capitalize the cost of these assets, including freight and installation charges.\\nCertain property you produce for use in your trade or business must be capitalized under the uniform capitalization rules. See Regulations section 1.263A-2 for information on these rules.\\nYou may not deduct any depreciation expense from certain property that is used exclusively for personal purposes.\\n### Taxes\\nThe tax laws change frequently, so it is important to consult with a tax professional before making any decisions regarding taxes.\\nIf you have income from foreign sources, you must report this income on Form W-8BENE. If you do not file this form, you may be subject to penalties and interest.\\nIf you owe taxes, you can pay them online through the IRS website. However, if you cannot pay the full amount due, you should contact the IRS to discuss payment options.\\n### Retirement Plans\\nRetirement plans come in various forms, such as defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and annuities. Each type has its own set of rules and requirements. It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor to determine which plan is best suited for your needs.\\nIt is also important to note that contributions made to retirement plans are generally tax-deductible up to certain limits. These limits vary depending on your age and other factors.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Deducting Business Expenses\\nPage 5* You have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business.\\nIf you have more than one business location, determine your principal place of business based on the following factors.\\n* The relative importance of the activities performed at each location.\\n* If the relative importance factor does not determine your principal place of business, consider the time spent at each location.\\n_Optional safe harbor method._ Individual taxpayers can use the optional safe harbor method to determine the amount of deductible expenses attributable to certain business use of a residence during the tax year. This method is an alternative to the calculation, allocation, and substantiation of actual expenses.\\nThe deduction under the optional method is limited to $1,500 per year based on $5 per square foot for up to 300 square feet. Under this method, you claim your allowable mortag interest, real estate taxes, and casually losses on the home as itemized deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). You are not required to allocate these deductions between personal and business uses, as is required under the regular method. If you use the optional method, you cannot depreciate the portion of your home used in a trade or business.\\nBusiness expenses unrelated to the home, such as advertising, supplies, and wages paid to employees, are still fully deductible. All of the requirements discussed earlier under _Business use of your home_ still apply.\\nFor more information on the deduction for business use of your home, including the optional safe harbor method, see Pub. 587.\\n_If you were entitled to deduct depreciation on the part of your home used for business, you cannot exclude the part of the gain from the sale of your home that equals any depreciation you deducted (or could have deducted) for periods after May 6, 1997._\\n**Business use of your car.** If you use your car exclusively in your business, you can deduct car expenses. If you use your car for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual mileage. Generally, commuting expenses between your home and your business location, within the area of your tax home, are not deductible.\\nYou can deduct actual car expenses, which include depreciation (or lease payments), gas and oil, fires, repairs, tune-ups, insurance, and registration fees. Or, instead of figuring the business part of these actual expenses, you may be able to use the standard mileage rate to figure your deduction. For 2022, the standard mileage rate is 58.5 cents per mile before July 1, 2022, and 62.5 cents per mile on or after July 1, 2022. To find the standard mileage rate for 2023, go to _(IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates_.\\nIf you are self-employed, you can also deduct the business part of interest on your car loan, state and local personal property tax on the car, parking fees, and tolls, whether or not you claim the standard mileage rate.\\nFor more information on car expenses and the rules for using the standard mileage rate, see Pub. 463.\\n_If you were entitled to deduct depreciation on the part of your car used for business, you cannot exclude the part of the gain from the sale of your car that equals any depreciation you deducted (or could have deducted) for periods after May 6, 1997._\\n**Business use of your computer.** If you use your computer exclusively in your business, you can deduct computer expenses. However, if you use your computer for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual usage.\\nComputer expenses include the cost of hardware, software, maintenance, and repair, as well as the cost of internet access and online services. You can either deduct all of these expenses immediately or capitalize them and expense them over time through bonus depreciation or Section 179.\\nTo determine the amount of immediate expensing, multiply the purchase price of qualifying computer equipment by 50% for computers acquired before December 31, 2017, and 100% for computers acquired after December 31, 2017. Computers acquired before January 1, 2018, do not qualify for bonus depreciation but may be eligible for Section 179.\\nFor more information on computer expenses and the rules for determining the amount of immediate expensing, see Pub. 539.\\n_If you were entitled to deduct depreciation on the part of your computer used for business, you cannot exclude the part of the gain from the sale of your computer that equals any depreciation you deducted (or could have deducted) for periods after May 6, 1997._\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## How Much Can I\\n**Deduct?**\\nGenerally, you can deduct the full amount of a business expense if it meets the criteria of ordinary and necessary and it is not a capital expense.\\n**Recovery of amount deducted (tax benefit rule).** If you recover part of an expense in the same tax year in which you would have claimed a deduction, reduce your current year expense by the amount of the recovery. If you have a recovery in a later year, include the recovered amount in income in that year. However, if part of the deduction for the expense did not reduce your tax, you do not have to include that part of the recovered amount in income.\\nFor more information on recoveries and the tax benefit rule, see Pub. 525.\\n**Payments in kind.** If you provide services to pay a business expense, the amount you can deduct is limited to your out-of-pocket costs. You cannot deduct the cost of your own labor.\\nSimilarly, if you pay a business expense in goods or other property, you can deduct only what the property costs you. If these costs are included in the cost of goods sold, do not deduct them again as a business expense.\\n**Limits on losses.** If your deductions for an investment or business activity are more than the income it brings in, you have a loss. There may be limits on how much of the loss you can deduct.\\n**Not-for-profit limits.** If you carry on your business activity without the intention of making a profit, you cannot use a loss from it to offset other income. For more information, see _Not-for-profit Activities_, later.\\n**At-risk limits.** Generally, a deductible loss from a trade or business or other income-producing activity is limited to the investment you have \"at risk\" in the activity. You are at risk in any activity for the following.\\n1. The money and adjusted basis of property you contribute to the activity.\\n2. Amounts you borrow for use in the activity if: 1. You are personally liable for repayment, or 2. You pledge property (other than property used in the activity) as security for the loan.\\nFor more information, see Pub. 925.\\n_Passive activities._ Generally, you are in a passive activity if you have a trade or business activity in which you do not materially participate, or a rental activity. In general, deductions for losses from passive activities only offset income from passive activities. You cannot use any excess deductions to offset other income. In addition, passive activity credits can only offset the tax on net passive income. Any excess loss or credits are carried over to later years. Suspended passive losses are fully deductible in the year you completely dispose of the activity. For more information, see Pub. 925.\\n**Not operating loss (NOL).** If your deductions are more than your income for the year, you may have an NOL. You can use an NOL to lower your taxes in other years. See Pub. 536 for more information.\\nSee Pub. 542 for information about NOLs of corporations.\\n**Carryover of NOLs.** An NOL carries forward to future years until it is used up. If you have an NOL after the year in which it was created, you can apply it against the next year\\'s tax liability. If you have no tax liability in the next year, you can carry the NOL forward to future years.\\nIf you have an NOL from a corporation, you can use it to offset corporate tax liability in future years.\\n**Tax credit for foreign taxes paid.** If you pay foreign taxes on your income, you may be able to claim a credit for those taxes on your U.S. tax return. See Pub. 519 for more information.\\n**Foreign tax credit limitations.** There may be limits on the amount of foreign tax credits you can claim.\\n**Foreign tax credit expiration.** Foreign tax credits expire after 7 years unless they are used to offset U.S. tax liability in the year they were earned.\\n**Foreign tax credit recapture.** If you receive a refund of foreign taxes, you must recapture any unused foreign tax credits.\\n**Foreign tax credit carryforward.** If you have unused foreign tax credits, you can carry them forward to future years.\\n**Foreign tax credit carryback.** If you have unused foreign tax credits, you can also carry them back to earlier years.\\n**Foreign tax credit offset.** If you owe U.S. taxes on income that has been subject to foreign taxes, you can offset some or all of your U.S. tax liability with foreign tax credits.\\n**Foreign tax credit exclusion.** If you owe U.S. taxes on income that has been subject to foreign taxes, you may be able to exclude some or all of your U.S. tax liability if certain conditions are met.\\n**Foreign tax credit limitation.** There may be limits on the amount of foreign tax credits you can claim.\\n**Foreign tax credit expiration.** Foreign tax credits expire after 7 years unless they are used to offset U.S. tax liability in the year they were earned.\\n**Foreign tax credit recapture.** If you receive a refund of foreign taxes, you must recapture any unused foreign tax credits.\\n**Foreign tax credit carryforward.** If you have unused foreign tax credits, you can carry them forward to future years.\\n**Foreign tax credit carryback.** If you have unused foreign tax credits, you can also carry them back to earlier years.\\n**Foreign tax credit offset.** If you owe U.S. taxes on income that has been subject to foreign taxes, you can offset some or all of your U.S. tax liability with foreign tax credits.\\n**Foreign tax credit exclusion.** If you owe U.S. taxes on income that has been subject to foreign taxes, you may be able to exclude some or all of your U.S. tax liability if certain conditions are met.\\n**Foreign tax credit limitation.** There may be limits on the amount of foreign tax credits you can claim.\\n**Foreign tax credit expiration.** Foreign tax credits expire after 7 years unless they are used to offset U.S. tax liability in the year they were earned.\\n**Foreign tax credit recapture.** If you receive a refund of foreign taxes, you must recapture any unused foreign tax credits.\\n**Foreign tax credit carryforward.** If you have unused foreign tax credits, you can carry them forward to future years.\\n**Foreign tax credit carryback.** If you have unused foreign tax credits, you can also carry them back to earlier years.\\n**Foreign tax credit offset.** If you owe U.S. taxes on income that has been subject to foreign taxes, you can'],\n",

Following the format of the examples below to include context, question, and answer in the response.\\ncontext: In 1948, Claude E. Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication (Shannon, 1948) establishing the theory of information. In his article, Shannon introduced the concept of information entropy for the first time. We will begin our journey here.\\nquestion: Question 1: Who published A Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1948?; Question 2: What concept did Shannon introduce in his 1948 article?; Question 3: What field was established by Shannon\\'s 1948 publication?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Claude E. Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## When Can I\\n**Deduct an Expense?**\\nWhen you can deduct an expense depends on your accounting method. An accounting method is a set of rules used to determine when and how income and expenses are reported. The two basic methods are the cash method and the accrual method. Whichever method you choose must clearly reflect income.\\nFor more information on accounting methods, see Pub. 538.\\n**Cash method.** Under the cash method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses in the tax year you pay them.\\n**Accural method.** Under the accrual method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses when both of the following apply.\\n1. The all-events test has been met. The test is met when: 1. All events have occurred that fix the fact of liability, and 2. The liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.\\n2. Economic performance has occurred.\\n_Economic performance._ You generally cannot deduct or capitalize a business expense until economic performance occurs. If your expense is for property or services provided to you, or for your use of property, economic performance occurs as the property or services are provided, or the property is used. If your expense is for property or services you provide to others, economic performance occurs as you provide the property or services.\\n_Example._ Your tax year is the calendar year. In December 2022, the Field Plumping Company did some repair work at your place of business and sent you a bill for $600. You paid it by check in January 2023. If you use the accrual method of accounting, deduct the $600 on your tax return for 2022 because all events have occurred to \"fix\" the fact of liability (in this case, the work was completed), the liability can be determined, and economic performance occurred in that year.\\nIf you use the cash method of accounting, deduct the expense on your 2023 tax return.\\n**Prepayment.** You generally cannot deduct expenses in advance, even if you pay them in advance. This applies to prepaid interest, prepaidinsurance premiums, and any other prepaid expense that creates an intranight asset. If you play an amount that creates an intranight asset, then you must capitalize the amounts paid and begin to amortize the payment over the appropriate period.\\nHowever, you do not have to capitalize amounts for creating an intangible asset if the right or benefit created does not extend beyond the earlier of 12 months after the date that you first receive the right or benefit or the end of the tax year following the year in which you made the advance payment. If you are a cash method taxapayer and your advance payment qualifies for this exception, then you can generally deduct the amount when paid. If you are an actual method taxapayer, you cannot deduct the amount until the all-events that has been met and economic performance has occurred.\\n**Example 1**.: In 2022, you sign a 10-year lease and immediately pay your rent for the first 3 years. Even though you paid the rent for 2022, 2023, and 2024, you can only deduct the rent for 2022 on your 2022 tax return. You can deduct the rent for 2023 and 2024 on your tax returns for those years.\\n**Example 2**.: You are a cash method calendar year taxapayer. On December 1, 2022, you sign a 12-month lease, effective beginning January 1, 2023, and immediately pay your rent for the entire 12-month period that begins on January 1, 2023. The right or benefit attributable to the payment neither extends more than 12 months beyond January 1, 2023 (the first day that you are entitled to use the property) nor beyond the tax year ending December 31, 2023 (the year following the year in which you made the advance payment). Therefore, your prepayment does not have to be capitalized, and you can deduct the entire payment in the year you pay it.\\n**Contested liability.** Under the cash method, you can deduct a contested liability only in the year you pay the liability. Under the accual method, you can deduct contested liabilities such as taxes (except foreign or U.S. possession income, war profits, and excess profits taxes) either in the tax year you the liability (or transfer money or other property to satisfy the obligation) or in the tax year you settle the contest. However, to take the deduction in the year of payment or transfer, you must meet certain conditions. See Regulations section 1.461-2.\\n**Related person.** Under the accual method of accounting, you generally deduct expenses when you incur them, even if you have not yet paid them. However, if you and the person you are related and that person uses the cash method of accounting, you must pay the expense before you can deduct it. Your deduction is allowed when the amount is including in income by the related cash method paye. For more information, see _Related Persons_ in Pub. 538.\\nThe benefit gained by making this election is that the IRS will not immediately question whether your activity is engaged in for profit. Accordingly, it will not restrict your deductions. Rather, you will gain time to earn a profit in the required number of years. If you show 3 (or 2) years of profit at the end of this period, your deductions are not limited under these rules. If you do not have 3 (or 2) years of profit, the limit can be applied retroactively to any year with a loss in the 5-year (or 7-year) period.\\nFiling Form 5213 automatically extends the period of limitations on any year in the 5-year (or 7-year) period to 2 years after the due date of the tax return for the last year of the period. The period is extended only for deductions that the activity and any related deductions that might be affected.\\n**Type 1**: _You must file Form 5213 within 3 years after the due date of your tax return (determined without extensions) for the year in which you first carried on the activity, or, if earlier, within 60 days after receiving written notice from the IRS proposing to disallow deductions attributable to the activity._\\n**Cross income**\\nGross income from a not-for-profit activity includes the total of all gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property, and all other gross recegies derived from the activity. Gross income from the activity also includes capital gains and rents received for the use of property that is held in connection with the activity.\\nYou can determine gross income from any not-for-profit activity by subtracting the cost of goods sold from your gross recegies. However, if you determine gross income by subtracting cost of goods sold from gross recegies, you must do so consistently, and in a manner that follows generally accepted methods of accounting.\\n**Cost of goods sold:** Cost of goods sold consists of the costs of acquiring inventory, producing inventory, and selling inventory. It also includes the costs of providing services, and the costs of using property and equipment.\\n**Examples:**\\n* If you sell merchandise, cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchasing the merchandise, shipping charges, insurance, storage charges, and any other costs associated with the merchandise.\\n* If you provide services, cost of goods sold includes the wages paid to employees who perform the service, salaries paid to officers, directors, and key employees, and any other costs associated with providing the service.\\n* If you use property and equipment, cost of goods sold includes depreciation, maintenance, repairs, insurance, taxes, and any other costs associated with using the property and equipment.\\n**Rents received:** Rents received for the use of property that is held in connection with the activity include rents received from tenants, lessees, customers, clients, and patrons.\\n**Capital gains:** Capital gains consist of the difference between the basis of property sold and its fair market value at the time of sale. Basis is the original purchase price plus any improvements made to the property, less any accumulated depreciation. Fair market value is the price that would be received for the property in the open market.\\n**Example:**\\nIf you sell a piece of land that you purchased for $10,000 and improved with a fence worth $5,000, your basis is $15,000 ($10,000 + $5,000). If you sell the land for $20,000, your capital gain is $5,000 ($20,000 - $15,000).\\n**Tax treatment of rental income:** Rental income is subject to federal income tax unless it is exempted by law. Generally, rental income is considered ordinary income, but there are special rules that may affect the tax treatment of rental income. For example, if you own rental property that is classified as real estate investment trust (REIT) property, you may be able to exclude up to 99% of your rental income from federal income tax. To qualify for this exclusion, you must meet certain requirements. For more information, see _Real Estate Investment Trusts_ in Pub. 544.\\n**Losses:** Losses from a not-for-profit activity are deductible only if they are realized through a sale, exchange, or other disposition of property, or through the termination of leases. Realized losses are deductible only if they exceed the cost of goods sold. Unrealized losses are not deductible.\\n**Example:**\\nIf you sell merchandise that you acquired for $10,000 and sold for $5,000, your realized loss is $5,000 ($10,000 - $5,000). If you sell merchandise that you acquired for $10,000 and sold for $15,000, your realized gain is $5,000 ($15,000 - $10,000).\\n**Unrealized losses:** Unrealized losses occur when you realize a gain on the sale of property that you bought for a lower price. These losses are not deductible. Instead, they increase your basis in the property.\\n**Example:**\\nIf you buy stock for $10 per share and later sell'],\n",

One member operates a day care center, another provides consulting services, and the third sells products online. The partnership determines that all three activities are carried out as part of its business. However, only the day care center qualifies as a not-for-profit activity because it serves a charitable purpose. Therefore, the partnership can claim a tax credit for the wages paid to employees working at the day care center but cannot claim any credit for the wages paid to employees working in the other two activities._\\nquestion: Question 1: When does the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages expire? ; Question 2: How do partnerships and S corporations determine if they qualify for the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages? ; Question 3: Can a partnership claim a tax credit for the wages paid to employees working in multiple activities?\\nanswer: Answer 1: October 1, 2021; Answer 2: Partnerships and S corporations determine if they qualify for the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages by considering the degree of organizational and economic interrelationship of various underkings, the business purpose that is (or might be) served by carrying on the various underkings separately or together in a business or investment setting, and the similarity of the underkings.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## 2 Test 2--For Services Performed\\nYou must be able to prove the payment was made for services actually performed.\\n**Employee-shareholder salaries.** If a corporation pays an employee who is also a shareholder a salary that is unreasonably high considering the services actually performed, the excessive part of the salary may be treated as a constructive div div dividend to the employee-shareholder. The excessive part of the salary wouldn't be allowed as a salary deduction by the corporation. For more information on corporate distributions to shareholders, see Pub. 542.\\n**Rent payments.** Rent paid to a property owner who is also a shareholder of the tenant company may not be considered a business expense if it exceeds the fair market value of rent charged to non-shareholder tenants. This excess amount would be treated as a constructive dividend to the shareholder-tenant.\\n**Interest payments.** Interest paid to a shareholder who is also a borrower of the corporation may not be considered a business expense if it exceeds the interest rate charged to non-shareholder borrowers. This excess amount would be treated as a constructive dividend to the shareholder-borrower.\\n**Dividends received from related parties.** Dividends received from related parties are taxed at ordinary income rates unless they are reinvested in the corporation or used to purchase additional shares. Reinvestment of dividends can reduce the after-tax cost of capital.\\n**Stock options.** Stock options granted to employees or directors are generally considered compensation expenses. However, stock options granted to employees or directors who are also shareholders are subject to special rules. These options are generally treated as equity awards rather than compensation expenses. Equity awards are reported on Form W-2 as wages.\\n**Restricted stock units (RSUs).** RSUs are awarded to employees or directors who agree to remain with the company for a specified period. They vest over time and are subject to certain restrictions. RSUs are generally treated as equity awards rather than compensation expenses.\\n**Phantom stock.** Phantom stock represents ownership in a company that has been acquired through a merger or acquisition. It is often used as a substitute for cash consideration in such transactions. Phantom stock is generally treated as equity rather than debt.\\n**Retained earnings.** Retained earnings represent the portion of a company's profits that have been accumulated over time but not distributed to shareholders. Retained earnings can be used to fund future growth or pay dividends.\\n**Pension plans.** Pension plans provide retirement benefits to employees. Employees contribute funds to the plan, which are then invested in assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. The employer matches the employee contributions up to a certain level. Pension plans are subject to various regulations and requirements under ERISA.\\n**Health savings accounts (HSAs).** HSAs allow individuals to save money for healthcare expenses on a tax-free basis. Contributions to an HSA are limited by law and must be made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals from an HSA are tax-free only if they are used for qualified medical expenses.\\n**Flexible spending accounts (FSAs).** FSAs allow employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain expenses such as health insurance premiums, dependent care expenses, and transportation costs. FSAs are subject to certain limitations and conditions.\\n**Cafeteria plans.** Cafeteria plans allow employees to choose between receiving cash or other fringe benefits such as health insurance, dental insurance, and life insurance. The value of these benefits is determined by the employee's choice.\\n**Transportation reimbursements.** Transportation reimbursements provided to employees for work-related travel are generally taxable. However, there are certain exceptions where reimbursements may be tax-free.\\n**Business meals and entertainment.** Business meals and entertainment provided to employees are generally taxable. However, there are certain exceptions where meals and entertainment may be tax-free.\\n**Gifts and incentives.** Gifts and incentives provided to employees are generally taxable.

If you give property to an employee as an employee achievement award, your deduction may be limited.\\n**Achievement awards.** An achievement award is an item of tangible personal property that meets all the following requirements.\\n* It is given to an employee for length of service or safety achievement.\\n* It is awarded as part of a meaningful presentation.\\n* It is awarded under conditions and circumstances that don't create a significant likelihood of disguised pay.\\n_Tangle personal property._ An award isn't an item of tangible personal property if it is an award of cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements granting only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited assortment of items preselected or preapproved by you). Also, tangible personal property doesn't include vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items.\\n_Length-of-service award._ An award will qualify as a length-of-service award only if either of the following applies.\\n* The employee receives the award after their first 5 years of employment.\\n* The employee didn't receive another length-of-service award (other than one of very small value) during the same year or in any of the prior 4 years.\\n_Safety achievement award._ An award for safety achievement will qualify as an achievement award unless one of the following applies.\\n1. It is given to a manager, administrator, clerical employee, or other professional employee.\\n2. During the tax year, more than 10% of your employees, excluding those listed in (1), have already received a safety achievement award (other than one of very small value).\\n_Deduction limit._ Your deduction for the cost of employee achievement awards given to any one employee during the tax year is limited to the following.\\n* S400 for awards that aren't qualified plan awards.\\n* S1,600 for all awards, whether or not qualified plan awards.\\nA qualified plan award is an achievement award given as part of an established written plan or program that doesn't favor highly compensated employees as to eligibility or benefits.\\nA highly compensated employee is an employee who meets either of the following tests.\\n1. The employee was a 5% owner at any time during the year or the preceding year.\\n2. The employee received more than $130,000 in pay for the preceding year.\\nYou can choose to ignore test (2) if the employee wasn't also in the top 20% of employees when ranked by pay for the preceding year.\\nAn award isn't a qualified plan award if the average cost of all the employee achievement awards given during the tax year (that would be qualified plan awards except for this limit) is more than $400. To figure this average cost, ignore awards of nominal value.\\nDeduct achievement awards, up to the maximum amounts listed earlier, as a nonwage business expense on your return or business schedule.\\n_You may not over employment taxes on the value of some achievement awards you provide an employee.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Bonuses\\nYou can generally deduct a bonus paid to an employee if you intended the bonus as additional pay for services, not as a gift, and the services were performed. However, the total bonuses, salaries, and other pay must be reasonable for the services performed. If the bonus is paid in property, see _Property_, later.\\n**Gifts of nominal value.** If, to promote employee goodwill, you distribute merchandise of nominal value or other de minimis items to your employees at holidays, you can deduct the cost of these items as a nonwage business expense. See Pub. 15-B for additional information on de minimis fringe benefits. If you provide food to your employees, your business deduction may be limited; see _Meals and lodging_, later.\\nquestion: Question 1: When are bonuses considered as gifts? ; Question 2: How do we determine whether bonuses are reasonable for the services performed? ; Question 3: Can we deduct the cost of gifts of nominal value?\\nanswer: Answer 1: Bonuses are considered as gifts when they are paid as a form of gratuity or reward, rather than as additional pay for services. ; Answer 2: Whether bonuses are reasonable for the services performed depends on various factors such as the amount, timing, and frequency of payments. It also depends on the industry standards and practices. ; Answer 3: Yes, we can deduct the cost of gifts of nominal value as long as they are distributed during holiday seasons or other occasions to promote employee goodwill.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## 6 Fringe Benefits\\nA fringe benefit is a form of pay for the performance of services. You can generally deduct the cost of fringe benefits.\\nYou may be able to exclude all or part of the value of some fringe benefits from your employers\\' pay. You also may not use employment taxes on the value of the fringe benefits. See Table 2-1 in Pub. 15-B for details.\\nGenerally, no deduction is allowed for activities generally considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or for a facility used in connection with such activity. However, you may deduct these expenses if the goods, services, or facilities are treated as compensation to the recipient and reported on Form W-2 for an employee or on Form 1099-NEC for an independent contract. If the recipient is an officer, director, beneficial owner (directly or indirectly), or other \"specified individual\" (as defined in section 274(e)(2)(B) and Regulations section 1.274-9(b), special rules apply. See section 274(e)(2) and Regulations sections 1.274-9 and 1.274-10.\\nCertain fringe benefits are discussed next. See Pub. 15-B for more details on these and other fringe benefits.\\nMeals and lodging.Generally, you can deduct 50% of certain meal expenses and 100% of certain lodging expenses provided to your employees. If the amounts are deductible, deduct the cost in whatever category the expense falls.\\nDeduction limit on mealsYou can generally deduct only 50% of the cost of furnishing meals to your employees. However, you can deduct the full cost of certain meals; see section 274(n)(2) and Regulations section 1.274-12(c) for more information. For example, you can deduct the full cost of the following meals.\\nMeals whose value you include in an employee\\'s wages.\\nMeals you furnish to your employees as part of the expense of providing recreational or social activities, such as holiday parties or annual prichens, when made primarily for the benefit of your employees other than employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners who own a 10% or greater interest in your business, or other highly compensated employees.\\nMeals you furnish to your employees at the work site when you operate a restaurant or catering service.\\nMeals you/re required by federal law to furnish to crew members of certain commercial vessels (or would be required to furnish if the vessels were operated at sea). This doesn\\'t include such furnish on vessels primarily providing luxury water transportation.\\nMeals you furnish on an oil or gas platform or drilling rig located offshore or in Alaska. This includes meals you furnish at a support cam that is near and integral to an oil or gas drilling rig located in Alaska.\\nP.L. 115-97, Tax Cuts and Jobs Actchanged the rules for the deduction of food or beverage expenses that are excluelable from employee income as a de minimising fringe benefit. For amounts incurred or paid after 2017, the 50% limit on deductions for food or beverage expenses also applies to food or beverage expenses excludeable from employee income as a dub minis fringe benefit. While your business deduction may be limited, the rules that allow you to exclude certain de minimis meals and meals on your business premises from your employee\\'s wages still apply. See Meals in section 2 of Pub. 15-B.\\nFood and beverage expense incurred together with entertainment expensesP.L. 115-97 changed the rules for the deduction of business entertainment expenses. For amounts incurred or paid after 2017, no business deduction is allowed for any item generally considered to be entertainment, amusement, or recreation. As discussed earlier, you can deduct 50% of the cost of business meals. If food and beverages are provided during or at an entertainment activity, and the food and beverages are purchased separately from the entertainment, or the cost of the food and beverages is stated separately from the intent on one or more bills, involos, or recebits, you may continue to deduct 50% of the business meal expenses. The amount charged for food or beverages on a bill, invice, or receipt must reflect the venue\\'s usual selling cost for those items if they were to be purchased separately from the entertainment or must approximate the reasonable value of those items. If you purchase food and beverages together with entertainment expenses and the cost of the food and beverages isn\\'t stated separately on the invice, the cost of the food and beverages is also an entertainment expense and none of the expenses are deductible. For more information, including details about additional requirements that must be met for a business meal to be deductible, see Regulations sections 1.274-11 and 1.274-12(a).\\nThe Section 210 of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 provides for the temporary allowance of a 100% business meal deduction for food or beverages provided by a restaurant and paid or incurred after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2023. For more information, see Notice 2021-25, 2021-17 I.R. 1118, available at IRS.govwith2021-17 IBRNOT:2021-25; and Notice 2021-63, 2021-49 I.R. 835, available at IRS.govwith2021-49 IBRNOT:2021-63.\\nTransportation (commuting) benefitsIf you provide your employees with qualified transportation benefits, such as transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking, you may no longer deduct these amounts. P.L. 115-97 provides that no deduction is allowed for qualified transportation benefits (whether provided directly by you, through a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, or through a compensation reduction agreement) incurred or paid after 2017. Also, no deduction is allowed for any expense incurred for providing any transportation, or any payment or reimbursement to your employee, in connection with travel between your employees\\'s residence and place of employment, except as necessary for ensuring the safety of your employee or for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursments as described in section 132(f)(5) (F). While you may no longer deduct payments for qualified transportation benefits, the fringe benefit exclusion rules still apply and the payments, except for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursments, may be excluded from your employee\\'s wages. Although the value of a qualified transportation fringe benefit is relevant in determining the fringe benefit exclusion and whether the section 274(e)(2) exception for expenses treated as compensation applies, the deduction that is disallowed relates to the expense of providing a qualified transportation fringe, not its value. For more information, see Regulations sections 1.274-13 and 1.274-14. See Pub. 15-B for more information about qualified transportation benefits.\\nEmployee benefit programsEmployee benefit programs include the following.\\nAccident and health plansAction assistanceCafearia plansDependent care assistanceCafeaEducation assistanceCafe insuranceCafe insurance coverageLife insurance coverageYou can\\'t deduct the cost of life insurance coverage for you, an employee, or any person with a financial interest in your business if you drive directly or indirectly the beneficiary of the policy. See Regulations section 1.264-1 for more information.\\nWelfare benefit fundsA welfare benefit fund is a funded plan (or a funded arrangement having the effect of a plan) that provides welfare benefits to your employees, independent contractors, or their beneficiaries. Welfare benefits are any benefits other than deferred compensation or transfers of restricted property.\\nYour deduction for contributions to a welfare benefit fund is limited to the fund\\'s qualified cost for the tax year. If your contributions to the fund are more than its qualified cost, carry the excess over to the next tax year.\\nGenerally, the fund\\'s \"qualified cost\" is the total of the following amounts, reduced by the after-tax income of the fund.\\nThe cost you would\\'ve been able to deduct using the cash method of accounting if you had paid for the benefits directly.\\nThe contributions added to a reserve account that are needed to fund claims incurred but not paid as of the end of the year.\\nThese claims can be for supplemental unemployment benefits, severance pay, or disability, medical, or life insurance benefits.\\nFor more information, see sections 419(c) and 419A and the related regulations.\\nLoans or AdvancesYou can generally deduct as wages an advance you make to an employee for services to be performed if you don\\'t expect the employee to repay the advance. However, if the employee performs no services, treat the amount you advanced as a loan; if the employee doesn\\'t repay the loan, treat it as income to the employee.\\nBelow-market interest rate loansOn certain loans you make to an employee or shareholder, you\\'re treated as having received interest income and as having paid compensation or dividends equal to that interest. See Bz: _glow-Market Loans in chapter 4._\\nIn addition, you may be subject to excise taxes on certain types of loans or advances. See Chapter 4, Part II, section D for more information.\\nGiftsYou can generally deduct gifts you give to your employees up to $50 per employee per calendar year. However, there are limits on how much you can deduct as gifts to nonemployees.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Property\\nIf you transfer property (including your company\\'s stock) to an employee as payment for services, you can generally deduct it as wages. The amount you can deduct is the property\\'s fair market value (FMV) on the date of the transfer less any amount the employee paid for the property.\\nYou can claim the deduction only for the tax year in which your employee includes the property\\'s value in their income. Your employee is deemed to have included the value in their income if you report it on their Form W-2 in a timely manner.\\nYou treat the deductible amount as received in exchange for the property, and you must recognize any gain or loss realized on the transfer, unless it is the company\\'s stock transferred as payment for services. Your gain or loss is the difference between the FMV of the property and its adjusted basis on the date of transfer.\\nThese rules also apply to property transferred to an independent contractor for services, generally reported on Form 1099-NEC.\\n**Restricted property.** If the property you transfer for services is subject to restrictions that affect its value, you generally cart deduct it and don\\'t report gain or loss until it is substantially used in the recipient. However, if the recipient pays for the property, you must report any gain at the time of the transfer up to the amount paid.\\n\"Substantially vested\" means the property isn\\'t subject to a substantial risk of definitive. This means that the recipient isn\\'t likely to have to give up their rights in the property in the future. For example, if you transfer shares of stock that vest after three years from the date of transfer, they are considered substantially vested.\\n**Risk of forfeiture.** If the property you transfer has a risk of forfeiture, meaning there is a possibility that the recipient may not be entitled to receive the property, you generally cannot deduct it immediately. Instead, you must wait until the recipient actually receives the property before deducting it.\\nFor example, if you transfer shares of stock that vest over four years but have a risk of forfeiture, you would need to wait until the recipient actually receives the shares before deducting them.\\n**Disqualified persons.** Certain individuals who own more than 5% of the company being transferred are disqualified persons under IRS regulations. These individuals cannot participate in the transfer of restricted property without violating certain rules.\\n**Tax treatment of transfers of company stock.** Transfers of company stock as payment for services are treated as compensation transactions. You report these transactions on Form W-2, and the employee reports them on their personal tax return. The employee recognizes the compensation as income, and you recognize it as an expense.\\nThe tax treatment of transfers of company stock depends on whether the stock is subject to restrictions. If the stock is subject to restrictions, it is treated as restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs vest over time, and the employee recognizes the income when the RSUs vest. You recognize the expense when the RSUs vest.\\nIf the stock is not subject to restrictions, it is treated as ordinary income. The employee recognizes the income when they sell the stock, and you do not recognize any additional expense.\\n**Transfers of other types of property.** Transfers of other types of property, such as real estate or equipment, are generally treated as sales. You report the sale on Form 1097, and the employee reports the income on their personal tax return. The employee recognizes the income when they receive the proceeds, and you recognize the gain or loss on the transaction.'],\n",

Determine this value when you make the agreement.\\n* You have an option to buy the property at a nominal price compared to the total amount you have to pay under the agreement.\\n* The agreement designates part of the payments as interest, or that part is easy to recognize as interest.\\n_Leveraged leases_. Leveraged leases transactions may not be considered leases. Leveraged leases generally involve three parties: a lease, a lessee, and a lander to the leossor. Usually, the lease term covers a large part of the useful life of the leased property, and the lessee\\'s payments to the leaser are enough to cover the lessors payments to the lender.\\nIf you plan to take part in what appears to be a leveraged lease, you may want to get an advance ruling.\\n* Revenue Procedure 2001-28 contains the guidelines the IRS will use to determine if a leveraged lease is a lease for federal income tax purposes.\\n* Revenue Procedure 2001-29 provides the information required to be furnished in a request for an advance ruling on a leveraged lease transaction.\\nThese two revenue procedures can be found in I.R.B. 2001-19, which is available at _[BS.gov/tab/rs-its/tb01-19.pdf]_.\\nFor advance ruling purposes only, the IRS will consider the leossor in a leveraged lease transaction to be the owner of the property and the transaction to be a valid lease if all the factors in the revenue procedure are met, including the following.\\n* The lesser must maintain a minimum unconditional \"at risk\" equity investment in the property (at least 20% of the cost of the property) during the entire lease term.\\n* The lease may not have a contractual right to buy the property from the lessor at less than FMV when the right is exercised.\\n* The leasege may not invest in the property, except as provided by Revenue Procedure 2001-28.\\n* The lessee may not lend any money to the lesser to buy the property or guarantee the loan used by the leossor to buy the property.\\n* The lesser must show that it expects to receive a profit apart from the tax deductions, allowances, credits, and other tax attributes.\\nThe liability and amount of taxes are determined by state or local law and the lease agreement. Economic performance occurs as you use the property.\\n_Example 1._ Oak Corporation is a calendar year taxplayer that uses an accruval method of accounting. Oak leases land for use in its business. Under state law, owners of real property become liable (incur a len on the property) for real estate taxes for the year on January 1 of that year. However, they don\\'t have to pay these taxes until July 1 of the next year (18 months later) when tax bills are issued. Under the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes in the later year when the tax bills are issued. If the lease ends before the tax bill for a year is issued, Oak isn\\'t liable for the taxes for that year.\\nOak cannot deduct the real estate taxes as rent until the tax bill is issued. This is when Oak\\'s liability under the lease becomes fixed.\\n_Example 2._ The facts are the same as in _Example 1_, except that, according to the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes when the owner of the property becomes liable for them. As a result, Oak will deduct the real estate taxes as rent on its tax return for the earlier year. This is the year in which Oak\\'s liability under the lease becomes fixed.\\n_Example 3._ The facts are the same as in _Example 1_, except that, according to the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes when the owner of the property becomes liable for them. As a result, Oak will deduct the real estate taxes as rent on its tax return for the earlier year. However, Oak doesn\\'t expect to receive any rent from the property during the period between the date of the lease agreement and the date on which the owner of the property becomes liable for the real estate taxes. Therefore, Oak won\\'t be able to claim a deduction for the real estate taxes paid during this period.\\n_Example 4._ The facts are the same as in _Example 1_, except that, according to the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes when the owner of the property becomes liable for them. As a result, Oak will deduct the real estate taxes as rent on its tax return for the earlier year. However, Oak doesn\\'t expect to receive any rent from the property during the period between the date of the lease agreement and the date on which the owner of the property becomes liable for the real estate taxes. Therefore, Oak won\\'t be able to claim a deduction for the real estate taxes paid during this period.'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Cost of Getting a Lease\\nYou may either enter into a new lease with the lowest of the property or get an existing lease from another leasesee. Very often when you get an existing lease from another leasesee, you must pay the previous lessee money to get the lease, besides having to pay the rent on the lease.\\nIf you get an existing lease on property or equipment for your business, you must generally amortize any amount you pay to get that lease over the remaining term of the lease. For example, if you pay $10,000 to get a lease and there are 10 years remaining on the lease with no option to renew, you can deduct $1,000 each year.\\nThe cost of getting an existing lease of tangible property is not subject to the amortization rules for section 197 intangibles discussed in chapter 8.\\n**Option to renew.** The term of the lease for amortization includes all renewal options plus any other period for which you and the leossor reasonably expect the lease to be renewed. However, this applies only if less than 75% of the cost of getting the lease is for the term remaining on the purchase date (not including any period for which you may choose to renew, extend, or continue the lease). Allocate the lease cost to the original term and any option term based on the facts and circumstances. In some cases, it may be appropriate to make the allocation using a present value calculation. For more information, see Regulations section 1.178-1(b)(5).\\n**Example 1**.: You paid $10,000 to get a lease with 20 years remaining on it and two options to renew for 5 years each. Of this cost, you paid $7,000 for the original lease and $3,000 for the renewal options. Because $7,000 is less than 75% of the total $10,000 cost of the lease (or $7,500), you must amortize the $10,000 over 30 years. That is the remaining life of your present lease plus the periods for renewal.\\n**Example 2**.: The facts are the same as in _Example 1_, except that you paid $8,000 for the original lease and $2,000 for the renewal options. You can amortize the entire $10,000 over the 20-year remaining life of the original lease. The $8,000 cost of getting the original lease was not less than 75% of the total cost of the lease (or $7,500).\\n**Cost of a modification agreement.** You may have to pay an additional \"rent\" amount over part of the lease period to change certain provisions in your lease. You must capitalize these payments and amortize them over the remaining period of the lease. You can\\'t deduct the payments as additional rent, even if they are described as rent in the agreement.\\n**Example**.: You are a calendar year tax-payer and sign a 20-year lease to rent part of a building starting on January 1. However, before you occupy it, you decide that you really need less space. The lessor agrees to reduce your rent from $7,000 to $6,000 per year and to release the excess space from the original lease. In exchange, you agree to pay an additional rent amount of $3,000, payable in 60 monthly installments of $50 each.\\nYou must capitalize the $3,000 and amortize it over the 20-year term of the lease. Your amortization deduction each year will be $150 ($3,000 + 20). You can\\'t deduct the $600 (12 x $50) that you will pay during each of the first 5 years as rent.\\n**Commissions, bonuses, and fees.** Commissions, bonuses, fees, and other amounts you pay to get a lease on property you use in your business are capital costs. You must amortize these costs over the term of the lease.\\n**Loss on merchandise and fixtures.** If you sell at a loss merchandise and fixtures that you bought solely to get a lease, the loss is a cost of getting the lease. You must capitalize the loss and amortize it over the remaining term of the lease.\\n**Example**.: You buy a refrigerator for $1,000 to put in your store. After you open, you realize that you don\\'t need the refrigerator anymore. You sell it for $500. You must capitalize the $500 loss and amortize it over the remaining term of the lease.'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Improvements\\nIf you add buildings or make other permanent improvements to leased property, depreciate the cost of the improvements using the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS). Depreciate the property over its appropriate recovery period. You can't amortize the cost over the remaining term of the lease.\\nIf you don't keep the improvements when you end the lease, figure your gain or loss based on your adjusted basis in the improvements at that time.\\nFor more information, see the discussion of MACRS in chapter 4 of Pub. 946.\\n**Assignment of a lease.** If a long-term leasee who makes permanent improvements to land later assigns all lease rights to you for money and you pay the rent required by the lease, the amount you pay for the assignment is a capital investment. If the rental value of the leased land increased since the lease began, part of your capital investment is for that increase in the rental value. The rest is for your investment in the permanent improvements.\\nThe part that is for the increased rental value of the land is a cost of getting a lease, and you amortize it over the remaining term of the lease. You can depreciate the part that is for your investment in the improvements over the recovery period of the property as discussed earlier, without regard to the lease term.\\nYou must report any gain or loss from an assignment of a lease on Form 8500. For more information, see chapter 7 of Pub. 946.\\n**Disposition of a lease.** When you dispose of a lease, you recognize the portion of the lease payment that relates to the unexpired term of the lease as income. If you have made permanent improvements to the leased property, you also recognize the portion of the improvement cost that has not been recovered as a deduction.\\nIf you sell the lease, you recognize the portion of the sale price that represents the unexpired term of the lease as income. If you sold the lease with permanent improvements, you also recognize the portion of the improvement cost that has not been recovered as a deduction.\\nFor more information, see chapter 7 of Pub. 946.\\n**Leasehold taxation.** Leases are subject to state and local taxes. State and local governments may impose different types of taxes on leases, such as property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, and transfer taxes. These taxes depend on the type of lease, the location of the lease, and the jurisdiction where the lease is located.\\n**Tax treatment of leases.** Leases are generally treated as either operating expenses or capital investments depending on their terms and conditions. Operating expenses are deducted immediately from gross income, while capital investments are deducted over the useful life of the asset. Capital investments are also subject to depreciation.\\nOperating expenses include rent, utilities, maintenance, repairs, insurance, and other costs associated with the operation of the property. Capital investments include building construction, equipment purchases, and other assets that are expected to be used for business purposes for a significant period of time.\\nCapital investments are reported on Form 8500, which is used to report capital investments in real estate. Form 8500 includes information about the acquisition date, purchase price, estimated useful life, and depreciation method of each capital investment.\\n**Depreciation methods.** There are several depreciation methods available for capital investments, including straight-line depreciation, declining balance depreciation, sum-of-the-years'-digits depreciation, and double declining balance depreciation. Each method calculates the annual depreciation expense differently.\\nStraight-line depreciation calculates the annual depreciation expense by dividing the total cost of the asset by the number of years it is expected to be used. Declining balance depreciation calculates the annual depreciation expense by multiplying the original cost of the asset by a factor that decreases each year. Sum-of-the-years'-digits depreciation calculates the annual depreciation expense by taking into account the age of the asset. Double declining balance depreciation calculates the annual depreciation expense by multiplying the original cost of the asset by two and then applying a declining balance depreciation rate.\\n**Cost of goods sold.** Cost of goods sold is calculated by subtracting the beginning inventory from ending inventory plus the cost of goods manufactured during the accounting period. Beginning inventory is the inventory on hand at the beginning of the accounting period, while ending inventory is the inventory on hand at the end of the accounting period. Cost of goods manufactured is the direct labor, materials, and overhead costs incurred in producing the goods.\\n**Accounting periods.** Accounting periods are defined as the time intervals between the beginning and end of an organization\"],\n",

Include these costs in the basis of property you produce or acquire for resale, rather than claiming them as a current deduction. You recover the costs through depreciation, amortization, or cost of goods sold when you use, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property.\\nIndirect costs include amounts incurred for renting or leasing equipment, facilities, or land.\\n**Uniform capitalization rules.** You may be subject to the uniform capitalization rules if you do any of the following, unless the property is produced for your use other than in a business or an activity carried on for profit.\\n**Publication**\\n* 537 Installment Sales\\n* 550 Investment Income and Expenses\\n* 936 Home Mortgage Interest Deduction\\n**Form (and Instructions)**\\n**Schedule A (Form 1040)**\\n**Schedule E (Form 1040)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)**\\n**Schedule S Shareholder's Share of Income,\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)**\\n**Schedule S Shareholder's Share of Income,\\n**Schedule Credits, etc.\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)**\\n**Schedule S Shareholder's Share of Income,\\n**Schedule Credits, etc.\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 11098 Mortgage Interest Statement\\n**Schedule 1098 Mortgage Interest Statement\\n**Schedule 1109 Application for Change in Accounting Method**\\n**Schedule 1119 Application for Change in Accounting Method**\\n**Schedule 1120-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\\n**Schedule K-1 (Form 1121-S)**\"],\n",

If you use the proceeds of a loan for more than one type of expense, you must allocate the interest based on the use of the loan\\'s proceeds.\\nAllocate your interest expense to the following categories.\\nNompassive trade or business activity interest.\\nPassive trade or business activity interest.\\nInvestment interest.\\nPortfolio interest.\\nPersonal interest.\\nIn general, you allocate interest on a loan the same way you allocate the loan proceeds. You allocate loan proceeds by tracing disbursments to specific uses.\\nThe easiest way to trace disbursements to specific uses is to keep the proceeds of a particular loan separate from any other funds.\\nSecured loan.The allocation of loan proceeds and the related interest is generally not affected by the use of property that secures the loan.\\nMarge and Jeff secure a loan with property used in their business. They use the loan proceeds to buy an automobile for personal use. Jeff and Margo must allocate interest expense on the loan to personal use (purchase of the automobile) even though the loan is secured by business property.\\nP.L. 115-97, section 11043, limited the deduction for mortgage interest paid on home equity loans and line of credit. For more information, see Pub. 936.\\nAllocation period.The period for which a loan is allocated to a particular use begins on the date the proceeds are used and ends on the earlier of the following dates.\\nThe date the loan is repaid.\\nThe date the loan is reallocated to another use.\\nProceeds not disbursed to borrower.Even if the leader disburses the loan proceeds to a third party, the allocation of the loan is still based on your use of the funds. This applies whether you pay for property, services, or anything else by invorning a loan, or you take property subject to a debt.\\nProceeds deposited in borrower\\'s account.Treat loan proceeds deposited in an account as property held for investment. It does not matter whether the account pays interest. Any interest you pay on the loan is investment interest expense. If you withdraw the proceeds of the loan, you must reallocate the loan based on the use of the funds.\\nCelina, a calendar-year taxplayer, borrows $100,000 on January 4 and immediately uses the proceeds to open a checking account. No other amounts are deposited in the account during the year and no part of the loan principal is repaid during the year. On April 2, Celina uses $20,000 from the checking account for a passive activity expenditure. On September 4, Celina uses an additional $40,000 from the account for personal purposes.\\nUnder the interest allocation rules, the entire $100,000 loan is treated as property held for investment for the period from January 4 through April 1. From April 2 through September 3, Celina must treat $20,000 of the loan as used in the passive activity and $80,000 of the loan as property held for investment. From September 4 through December 31, the must treat $40,000 of the loan as used for personal purposes, $20,000 as used in the passive activity, and $40,000 as property held for investment.\\nOrder of funds spent.Generally, you treat loan proceeds deposited in an account as used (spend) before either of the following amounts.\\nAny unborrowed amounts held in the same account.\\nAny amounts deposited after these loan proceeds.\\nExample.On January 9, 9, 9 and 9 are the only one-to-you withdrew it until you either repay it or real-cate it to another use is personal interest expense. The interest charged on the loan proceeds you left in the account (S867) continues to be investment interest expense until you either repay it or real-cate it to another use.\\n**Loan repayment.** When you repay any part of a loan allocated to more than one use, treat it as being prepaid in the following order.\\n1. Personal use.\\n2. Investments and passive activities (other than those included in (3)).\\n3. Passive activities in connection with a rental real estate activity in which you actively participate.\\n4. Former passive activities.\\n5. Trade or business use and expenses for certain low-income housing projects.\\n**Line of credit (continuous borrowings).** The following rules apply if you have a line of credit or similar arrangement.\\n1. Treat all borrowed funds on which interest accrues at the same fixed or variable rate as a single loan.\\n2. Treat borrowed funds or parts of borrowed funds on which interest accrues at different fixed or variable rates as different loans. Treat these loans as repaid in the order shown on the loan agreement.\\n**Loan refinancing.** Allocate the replacement loan to the same uses to which the repaid loan was allocated. Make this allocation only to the extent you use the proceeds of the new loan to repay any part of the original loan.\\n**Debt-financed distribution.** A debt-financed distribution occurs when a partnership or S corporation borrows funds and allocates those funds to distributions made to partners or shareholders. The manner in which you report the interest expense associated with the distributed debt proceeds depends on your use of those proceeds.\\n_How to report._ If the proceeds were used in a nonpassive trade or business activity, report the interest on Schedule E (Form 1040), one 28; enter \"interest expense\" and the name of the partnership or S corporation in column (a) and the amount in column (i). If the proceeds were used in a passive activity, follow the instructions for Form 8582 to determine the amount of interest expense that can be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040), line 28; enter \"interest expense\" and the name of the partnership in column (a) and the amount in column (g). If the proceeds were used in an investment activity, enter the interest on Form 4952. If the proceeds are used for personal purposes, the interest is generally not deductible.\\nIf you receive a refund of interest you over-paid in an earlier year, this amount will be reported in how 44 of Form 1098. You cannot deduct this amount. For information on how to report this refund, see _Refunds.of interest_, later, in this chapter.\\n_Expenses paid to obtain a mortgage._ Certain expenses you pay to obtain a mortgage cannot be deducted as interest. These expenses, which include mortgage commissions, abstract fees, and recording fees, are capital expenses. If the property mortgaged is business or income-producing property, you can amortize the costs over the life of the mortgage.\\n_Prepayment penalty._ If you pay off your mortgage early and pay the lender a penalty for doing this, you can deduct the penalty as interest.\\n**Interest on employment tax deficiency.** Interest charged on employment taxes assessed on your business is deductible.\\n**Original issue discount (OID).** OID is a form of interest. A loan (mortgage or other debt) generally has OID when its proceeds are less than its principal amount. The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the loan.\\nA loan\\'s stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts (principal and interest) payable on it other than qualified stated interest. Qualified stated interest is standardised that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than another loan of the issuser) at least annually over the term of the loan at a single fixed rate.\\nYou generally deduct OID over the term of the loan. Figure the amount to deduct each year using the constant-yield method, unless the OID on the loan is de minimis.\\n_De minimis OID._ The OID is de minimis if it is less than one-fourth of 1% (0.0025) of the stated redemption price of the loan at maturity multiplied by the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity (the term of the loan).\\nIf the OID is de minimis, you can choose one of the following ways to figure the amount you can deduct each year.\\n* On a constant-yield basis over the term of the loan.\\n* On a straight-line basis over the term of the loan.\\n* In proportion to stated interest payments.\\n* In its entirety at maturity of the loan.\\nYou make this choice by deducting the OID in a manner consistent with the method chosen on your timely filed tax return for the tax year in which the loan is issued.\\n_Example._ On January 1, 2022, you took out a $100,000 discounted loan and received $98,500 in proceeds. The loan will mature on January 1, 2032 (a 10-year term), and the $100,000 principal is payable on that date. Interest of $10,000 is payable on January 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 2023. The $1,500 OID on the loan is de minimis because it is less than $2,500 ($100,000 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 0.0025 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 10). You choose to deduct the OID on a straight-linebasis over the term of the loan. Beginning in 2022, you can deduct $150 each year for 10 years.\\n_Constant-yield method._ If the OID is not de minimis, you must use the constant-yield method to figure how much you can deduct each year. You figure your deduction for the first year using the following steps.\\n1. Determine the issue price of the loan. Generally, this equals the proceeds of the loan. If you paid points on the loan (as discussed later), the issue price is generally the difference between the proceeds and the points.\\n2. Multiply the result in (1) by the yield to maturity.\\n3. Subtract any qualified stated interest payments from the result in (2). This is the OID you can deduct in the first year.\\nTo figure your deduction in any subsequent year, follow the steps above, except determine the adjusted issue price in step 1. To get the adjusted issue price, add to the issue price any OID previously deducted. Then follow steps 2 and 3 above.\\nThe yield to maturity is generally shown in the literature you receive from your lender. If you do not have this information, consult your tender or tax advisor. In general, the yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used in figuring the present value of all principal and interest payments, produces an amount equal to the principal amount of the loan.\\n_Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you deduct the OID on a constant-yield basis over the term of the loan. The yield to maturity on your loan is 10.2467%, compound annually. For 2022, you can deduct $93 ($98,500 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\Interest you paid or incurred during the production period must be capitalized if the property produced is designated property. Designated property is any of the following.\\n* Real property.\\n* Tangible personal property with a class life of 20 years or more.\\n* Tangible personal property with an estimated production period of more than 2 years.\\n* Tangible personal property with an estimated production period of more than 1 year if the estimated cost of production is more than 8T million.\\n**Property you produce.** You produce property if you construct, build, install, manufacture, develop, improve, create, raise, or grow it. Treat property produced for you under a contract as produced by you up to the amount you pay or incur for the property.\\n**Carrying charges.** Carrying charges include taxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or to carry, transport, or install personal property. You can choose to capitalize carrying charges not subject to the uniform capitalization rules if they are otherwise deductible. For more information, see _matter_.\\n**Capitalized interest:** Treat capitalized interest as a cost of the property produced. You recover your interest when you sell or use the property. If the property is inventory, recover capitalized interest through cost of goods sold. If the property is used in your trade or business, recover capitalized interest through an adjustment to basis, depreciation, amortization, or other method.\\n**Partnerships and S corporations.** The interest capitalization rules are applied first at the partnership or S corporation level. The rules are then applied at the partners or shareholders\\' level to the extent the partnership or S corporation has insufficient debt to support the production or construction costs.\\nIf you are a partner or a shareholder, you may have to capitalize interest you incur during the tax year for the production costs of the partnership or S corporation. You may also have to capitalize interest incurred by the partnership or S corporation for your own production costs. To properly capitalize interest under these rules, you must be given the required information in an attachment to the Schedule K-1 you receive from the partnership or S corporation.\\n**Additional information.** The procedures for applying the uniform capitalization rules are beyond the scope of this publication. For more information, see Repiquations sections 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 and Notice 88-99, which is in Cumulative Bulletin 1988-2.\\n**Tax treatment of interest paid on short-term debt.** Interest paid on short-term debt is generally considered ordinary income and is taxed at your marginal tax rate. However, there are some exceptions.\\n**Exceptions.** Interest paid on short-term debt is nontaxable if you meet the requirements of one of the following provisions.\\n* Section 1(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC): This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a resident alien who meets certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(h) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a U.S. citizen living abroad and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(j) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a member of the armed forces stationed outside the United States and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(l) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a dependent of a member of the armed forces stationed outside the United States and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(n) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a student enrolled at least half-time in an eligible educational institution and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(o) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a teacher employed by a public school system and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(r) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a research fellow, visiting professor, or other academic professional and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(v) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(w) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign service program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(x) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a cultural exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(z) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a government exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(aa) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign agricultural exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(bb) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign fisheries exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(cc) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign forestry exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(dd) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign mining exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1(ee) of the IRC: This provision allows you to exclude interest paid on short-term debt if you are a participant in a foreign energy exchange program and meet certain requirements.\\n* Section 1'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## 1 When To Deduct Interest\\nIf the uniform capitalization rules, discussed under _Capitalization of Interest_, earlier, and the business interest expense deduction limitation rules discussed under _Interest Expense Limitation_, earlier, do not apply, deduct interest as follows:\\n**Cash method.** Under the cash method, you can generally deduct any the interest you actually paid during the tax year. You cannot deduct a promissory note you gave as payment because it is a promise to pay and not an actual payment.\\n**Prepaid interest.** You generally cannot deduct any interest paid before the year it is due. Interest paid in advance can be deducted only in the tax year in which it is due.\\n**Discounted loan.** If interest or a discount is subtracted from your loan proceeds, it is not a payment of interest and you cannot deduct it when you get the loan. For more information, see _Original issue discount (OID)_ under _Interest Expense Limitation_.\\n**Response interest.** For any period, forgoin Interest is:\\n1. The interest that would be payable for that period if interest accrued on the loan at the AFB and was payable annually on December 31, minus\\n2. Any interest actually payable on the loan for the period.\\nlender and borrower total $100,000 or less. If the borrowers\\' net investment income is $1,000 or less, it is treated as zero. This limit does not apply to a loan if the avoidance of any federal tax is one of the main purposes of the interest arrangement.\\nTreatment of term loans.If you receive a below-market term loan other than a gift or demand loan, you are treated as receiving an additional cash payment (as a dividend, etc.) on the date the loan is made. This payment is equal to the loan amount minus the present value, at the AFR, of all payments due under the loan. The same amount is treated as OID on the loan. See _Original issue discount (OID) under Interest You Can Deduct_, earlier.\\nExceptions for loans of $10,000 or less.The rules for below-market loans do not apply to any day on which the total outstanding loans between the borrower and lender is $10,000 or less. This exception applies only to the following.\\n1. Gift loans between individuals if the loan is not directly used to buy or carry income-producing assets.\\n2. Compensation-related loans or corporation-shareholder loans if the avoidance of any federal tax is not a principal purpose of the interest arrangement.\\nThis exception does not apply to a term loan described in (2) above that was previously subject to the below-market loan rules. Those rules will continue to apply even if the outstanding balance is reduced to $10,000 or less.\\nExceptions for loans without significant tax effect.The following loans are specifically explored from the rules for below-market loans because their interest arrangements do not have a significant effect on the federal tax liability of the borrower or the lender.\\n1. Loans made available by lenders to the general public on the same terms and conditions that are consistent with the lender\\'s customary business practices.\\n2. Loans subsidized by a federal, state, or municipal government that are made available under a program of general application to the public.\\n3. Certain employee-relocation loans.\\n4. Certain loans to or from a foreign person, unless the interest income would be effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and not exempt from U.S. tax under an income tax treaty.\\n5. Any other loan if the taxayer can show that the interest arrangement has no significant effect on the federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower. Whether an interest arrangement has a significant effect on the federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower will be determined by all the facts and circumstances. Consider all the following factors.\\n1. Whether items of income and deduction generated by the loan offset each other.\\n2. The amount of the items.\\n3. The cost of complying with the below-market loan provisions if they were to apply.\\n4. Any reasons, other than taxes, for structuring the transaction as a below-market loan.\\nException for loans to qualified continuing care facilities.The below-market interest rules do not apply to a loan owed by a qualified continuing care facility under a continuing care contract if the lender or lenders\\'s exposure is age 62 or older by the end of the calendar year.\\nA qualified continuing care facility is one or more facilities (excluding nursing homes) meeting the requirements listed below.\\n1. Designed to provide services under continuing care contracts (defined below).\\n2. Includes an independent living unit, and either an assisted living or nursing facility, or both.\\n3. Substantially all of the independent living unit residents are covered by continuing care contracts.\\nA \"continuing care contract\" is a written contract between an individual and a qualified continuing care facility that includes all of the following conditions.\\n1. The individual or individual\\'s spouse must be entitled to use the facility for the rest of their life or lives.\\n2. The individual or individual\\'s spouse will be provided with housing, as appropriate for the health of the individual or individual\\'s spouse in an: 1. Independent living unit (which has additional available facilities outside the unit for the provision of meals and other personal care), and 2. Assisted living or nursing facility available in the continuing care facility.\\n3. The individual or individual\\'s spouse will be provided with assisted living or nursing care available in the continuing care facility, as required for the health of the individual or the individual\\'s spouse.\\nFor more information, see section 7872(h).\\nSale or exchange of property.Different rules generally apply to a loan connected with the sale or exchange of property. If the loan does not provide adequate stated interest, part of the principal payment may be considered interest. However, there are exceptions that may require you to apply the below-market interest rate rules to these loans.

Information Entropy\\nInformation entropy is a measure of randomness or uncertainty in a message or system. It is defined as the average amount of information produced when all possible outcomes are equally likely. In other words, it measures how much information is needed to represent a given message or system.\\nquestion: Question 1: How does information entropy relate to the concept of probability?; Question 2: Can you explain why information entropy is important in communication systems?; Question 3: What is the formula used to calculate information entropy?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Information entropy relates to the concept of probability through the use of probabilities in calculating the expected value of information. Probability represents the likelihood of an event occurring, while information entropy measures the degree of uncertainty about which event will occur.; Answer 2: Information entropy is important in communication systems because it provides a way to quantify the level of uncertainty or randomness in a message or system. This allows for more efficient coding and decoding of messages, leading to improved communication efficiency.; Answer 3: The formula used to calculate information entropy is H = -sum p\\\\_i log\\\\_2 p\\\\_i, where H is the information entropy, p\\\\_i is the probability of each outcome, and sum is taken over all possible outcomes.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## 6.\\nGenerally, you can only deduct taxes in the year you pay them. This applies whether you use the cash method or an accrual method of accounting.\\nUnder an accrual method, you can deduct a tax before you pay it if you meet the exception for recurring items discussed under _Economic Performance_ in Pub. 538. You can also elect to atably accrue real estate taxes as discussed later under _Real Estate Taxes_. See also _Foreign income taxes_, discussed later.\\n**Limitation on acceleration of accreval of taxes.** A taxing jurisdiction can require the use of a date for accreving taxes that is earlier than the date it originally required. However, if you use an accreval method, and can deduct the tax before you pay it, use the original accreval date for the year of change and all future years to determine when you can deduct the tax.\\n_Example._ Your state imposes a tax on personal property used in a trade or business conducted in the state. This tax is assessed and becomes a len of July 1 (accreval date). In 2022, the state changed the assessment and alien dates from July 1, 2023, to December 31, 2022, for property tax year 2023. Use the original accreval date (July 1, 2023) to determine when you can deduct the tax. You must also use the July 1 accreval date for all future years to determine when you can deduct the tax.\\n**Uniform capitalization rules.** Uniform capitalization rules apply to certain taxpayers who produce real property or tangible personal property for use in a trade or business or for sale to customers. They also apply to certain taxpayers who acquire property for resale. Under these rules, you either include certain costs in inventory or capitalize certain expenses related to the property, such as taxes. For more information, see chapter 1.\\n**Carrying charges.** Carrying charges include taxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or to carry, transport, or install personal property. You can elect to capitalize carrying charges not subject to the uniform capitalization rules if they are otherwise deductible. For more information, see chapter 7.\\n**Refunds of taxes.** If you receive a refund for any taxes you deducted in an earlier year, include the refund in income to the extent the deduction reduced your federal income tax in the earlier year. For more information, see _Recovery of amount deducted (tax benefit rule)_ in chapter 1.\\n_You must include in income any inter-set you receive on tax refunds._\\n**Tax treatment of foreign income taxes.** Foreign income taxes paid on U.S.-source income are generally treated as foreign income taxes paid on nonresident aliens. These taxes are included in gross income unless you qualify for a credit under section 6391. To claim this credit, you must file Form 1040-SR, Credit for Foreign Taxes Paid on U.S.-Source Income, with your return.\\nIf you have foreign income taxes paid on nonresident aliens, you may be able to claim a credit under section 6391. To do so, you must file Form 1040-SR, Credit for Foreign Taxes Paid on Nonresident Alien Income, with your return.\\nFor more information about foreign income taxes, see chapter 1.\\n**Deductions for contributions to charitable organizations.** Contributions made to qualified charities are generally deductible. However, there are limits on how much you can deduct each year. For more information, see chapter 1.\\n**Alimony paid.** Alimony paid to a spouse is generally considered taxable income to the recipient. It is reported on Form W-2, Wage and Self-Employment Tax Return, as wages.\\n**Child support payments.** Child support payments are generally nontaxable. They are reported on Form 1040, Schedule J, Itemized Deductions, as child support paid.\\n**Gifts to individuals.** Gifts to individuals are generally nontaxable up to $15,000 per person per calendar year ($30,000 per married couple filing jointly). Any gifts above this limit are taxable. Gifts to individuals are reported on Form 1040, Schedule B, Supplementary Information, as gifts received.\\n**Miscellaneous itemized deductions.** Miscellaneous itemized deductions include certain expenses that are not deductible under other categories. Examples include dues paid to professional societies, union fees, and investment advisory fees. These deductions are limited to 2% of adjusted gross income (AGI), which is AGI minus certain exclusions and inclusions. For more information, see chapter 1.\\n**Business expenses.** Business expenses are generally deductible if they are ordinary and necessary expenses for conducting a trade or business. There are limitations on certain types of expenses, such as meals and entertainment expenses.

Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication (Shannon, 1948) establishing the theory of information. In his article, Shannon introduced the concept of information entropy for the first time. We will begin our journey here.\\nquestion: Question 1: Who published A Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1948?; Question 2: What concept did Shannon introduce in his 1948 article?; Question 3: What field was established by Shannon\\'s 1948 publication?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Claude E. Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Real Estate Taxes\\nDeductible real estate taxes are any state or local taxes, including taxes imposed by U.S. possessions, on real estate levied for the general public welfare. The taxing authority must base the taxes on the assessed value of the real estate and charge them uniformly against all property under its jurisdiction. Decoitube real estate taxes generally do not include taxes charged for local benefits and improvements that increase the value of the property. See _Taxes for local benefits_, later.\\nReal estate taxes imposed by a foreign country are not deductible unless paid or accreved in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or for the production of income. For individual tax fliers, the amount of deductible state and local real estate taxes may be subject to a $10,000 limitation. See _State and local income taxes_, later.\\nIf you use an accreval method, you generally cannot accreval netlude with loan elect to accreule real estate tax related to a definite period ratably over that period.\\n_Example._ Lea and Joey are calendar year taxpayers who use an accreval method. Their real estate taxes for the real property tax year, july 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, are $1,200. July 1 is the assessment and join date.\\nIf the Lea and Joey elect to ratably accreule the taxes, $600 will accre in 2022 ($1,200 x $\\\\(\\\\%_{2}\\\\), July 1-December 31) and the balance will accre in 2023.\\n_Separate elections._ You can elect to ratably by accreule taxes for each separate trade or business and for nonbusiness activities if you account for them separately. Once you elect to ratably accreule real estate taxes, you must use that method unless you get permission from the IRS to change your accounting method. See _Form 3115_, later.\\n_Making the election._ If you elect to ratably accreule the taxes for the first year in which you incur real estate taxes, attach a statement to your income tax return for that year. The statement should show all the following items.\\n* The trades or businesses to which the election applies and the accounting method or methods used.\\n* The period to which the taxes relate.\\n* The calculation of the real estate tax deduction for that first year.\\nGenerally, you must file your return by the due date (including extensions). However, if you timely filed your return for the year without electing to ratably accreule, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months after the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Atch the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" on the statement. File the amended return at the same address where you filed the original return.\\n_Form 3115._ If you elect to ratably accreule real estate taxes for a year after the first year in which you incur real estate taxes, or if you want to revoke your election to ratably accreule real estate taxes, file Form 3115. For more information, including applicable time frames for filing, see the instructions for Form 3115.\\n_Taxes for local benefits_. Local benefits are services provided by a governmental unit for the benefit of its residents. Examples of local benefits include police protection, fire protection, street maintenance, and sanitation. These services are financed through taxes levied on real estate.\\n_State and local income taxes_. State and local income taxes are taxes imposed by states and local governments on personal income earned within their jurisdictions. These taxes are deductible as business expenses when they are paid or accumulated in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or for the production of income.\\n_Accrual method_. An accrual method is a bookkeeping method that recognizes revenue and expenses when they are earned or incurred, rather than when they are actually received or paid. This method is commonly used for financial reporting purposes.\\n_Assessment and join date_. The assessment and join date is the date on which the assessor determines the value of the property for taxation purposes and the date on which the property becomes subject to taxation.\\n_Netlude_. Netlude refers to the portion of a payment made before the effective date of the payment.\\n_Ratably_. Ratably means dividing something into equal parts.'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Income Taxes\\nThis section discusses federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes.\\n**Federal income taxes.** You cannot deduct federal income taxes.\\n**State and local income taxes.** A corporation or partnership can deduct state and local income taxes imposed on the corporation or partnership as business expenses.\\nAn individual can deduct state and local income taxes only as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), subject to limitations. The deduction is limited to $10,000 as a total of the following taxes.\\n1. State and local income taxes or general sales taxes. See the Schedule A (Form 1040) instructions.\\n2. State and local real estate taxes. See the Schedule A (Form 1040) instructions. See also _Real estate taxes_, earlier.\\n3. State and local personal property taxes.\\nHowever, an individual can deduct a state tax on gross income (as distinguished from net income) directly attributable to a trade or business as a business expense.\\n_Accural of contested income taxes_. If you use an accrual method, and you contest a state or local income tax liability, you must accrue and deduct any contested amount in the tax year in which the liability is finally determined.\\nIf additional state or local income taxes for a prior year are assessed in a later year, you can deduct the taxes in the year in which they were originally imposed (the prior year) if the tax liability is not contested. You cannot deduct them in the year in which the liability is finally determined.\\nThe filling of an income tax return is not considered a contest and, in the absence of an overt act of protest, you can deduct the tax in the prior year. Also, you can deduct any additional taxes in the prior year if you do not show some affirmative evidence of denial of the liability.\\nHowever, if you consistently deduct additional assessments in the year they are paid or finally determined (including those for which there was no contest), you must continue to do so. You cannot take a deduction in the earlier year unless you receive permission to change your method of accounting. For more information on accounting methods, see _When Cam 1 Deduct an Expense in chapter 1_.\\nIf you contest a state or local tax liability, and you transfer money or other property as a provisional payment of the contested tax liability, you can accrue and deduct the amount of the contested tax liability for which you made the provisional payment in the year in which you made the payment, even though the liability is not determined until a later year.\\nIf any portion of the contested amount which was deducted in the year the provisional payment was made is later refunded when the contest is settled, you must include such portion in your gross income in the year the refund is re-ceived.\\nNotwithstanding the exception that allows accrual and deduction of contested state or local income tax liability upon payment, current accrual and deduction is not allowed for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by a foreign country or possession of the United States.\\nForgen income taxes.Generally, you can take either a deduction or a credit for income taxes imposed on you by a foreign country or a U.S. possession, subject to limitations. However, an individual cannot take a deduction or credit for foreign income taxes paid on income that is exempt from U.S. tax under the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion. For information on these exclusions, see Pub. 54. For information on the foreign tax credit, see Pub. 54. For more information on self-employment tax, see Pub. 54.\\nFor more information on self-employment tax, see Pub. 334.\\nAdditional Medicare Tax.You may be required to pay Additional Medicare Tax on self-employment income.

This is a critical process that helps them determine premium rates and coverage limits.\\nquestion: Question 1: How do insurance companies assess risk? ; Question 2: Why is it important for insurance companies to assess risk accurately? ; Question 3: Can you explain the difference between actuarial science and statistical analysis in risk assessment?\\nanswer: Answer 1: Insurance companies use various methods such as historical data analysis, expert opinions, and scenario planning to assess risk. They also consider factors like age, gender, health status, occupation, location, and claims history. Answer 2: Accurate risk assessment helps insurance companies set fair premium rates and provide adequate coverage to policyholders. It also allows them to identify potential risks and take proactive measures to mitigate them. Answer 3: Actuarial science involves using mathematical models and statistical techniques to analyze past data and predict future outcomes. Statistical analysis, on the other hand, focuses specifically on collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and summarizing data. While both involve data analysis, actuarial science has a more specific focus on financial modeling and forecasting.\"],\n",

You election is good for only 1 year for unimproved and unproductive real property. You must decide whether to capitalize carrying charges each year the property remains unimproved and unproductive. For other real property, your election to capitalize carrying charges remains in effect until construction or development is completed. For personal property, your election is effective until the date you install or first use it, whichever is later.\\nHow to make the election.To make the election to capitalize a carrying charge, attach a statement to your original tax return for the year the election is to be effective indicating which charges you are electing to capitalize. However, if you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Attach the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-Z\" on the statement. File the amended return at the same address you filed the original return. If you fail to file the amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions), you cannot make the election.\\nWhat happens if you do not make the election?If you do not make the election to capitalize a carrying charge, the charge is treated as an expense that reduces your taxable income.

For more information, see Form 6765 and its instructions.\\n**Payroll tax credit.** The payroll tax credit is an annual election made by a qualified small business specifying the amount of research credit, not to exceed S250,000, that may be used against the employer portion of social security liability. The credit is the smallest of the current year research credit, an elected amount not to exceed S250,000, or the general business credit carryforward for the tax year (before the application of the payroll tax credit election for the tax year). The election must be made on or before the due date of the originally filed return (including extensions). An election cannot be made for a tax year if an election was made for 5 or more preceding tax years. The election made by a partnership or S corporation is made at the entity level.\\nA qualified small business that elects to claim the payroll tax credit will claim the payroll tax credit against the employer's portion of social security tax on its employment tax return for the first quarter that begins after it flies the return reflecting the payroll tax election. For more information, see the instructions for Form 6765.\\n**General business credit carryforward.** If a qualified small business does not use all of its available research credit during the tax year, it can carry forward the unused amount to future tax years. The maximum amount that may be carried forward is $2 million ($1 million per eligible entity). Any unused amount that has been carried forward from previous tax years is subject to certain limitations. See the instructions for Form 6765 for details.\\n**Eligible entities.** To qualify as a qualified small business, a taxpayer must meet the following requirements:\\n* It must have gross receipts less than $5 million for the tax year.\\n* It must have fewer than 500 employees at any point during the tax year.\\n* It must have no more than 50 full-time equivalent employees engaged in research activities during the tax year.\\n* It must have no more than 50 full-time equivalent employees engaged in research activities during the tax year who are compensated above $100,000 per year.\\nAn entity with gross receipts greater than $5 million but less than $10 million may still qualify as a qualified small business if it meets the other three requirements.\\n**Research credit.** The research credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in federal income tax liability resulting from qualified research expenses paid or incurred during the tax year. Qualified research expenses include wages paid to employees performing research, salaries paid to contractors performing research, supplies used in research, equipment used in research, software used in research, and computer hardware used in research.\\nTo determine whether expenses are qualified research expenses, the taxpayer must satisfy two tests:\\n* The expense must relate to basic research or advanced research. Basic research is defined as work undertaken to discover new laws of nature, develop new theories or models, solve complex problems, or test existing hypotheses. Advanced research is defined as work undertaken to apply scientific knowledge to practical problems or to develop products or processes.\\n* The expense must be treated as research under the rules of Modification and Simplification Act (MSA), which provides guidance on how to treat various types of expenses as research or nonresearch expenses. Expenses that do not meet these criteria are not considered qualified research expenses.\\nThe research credit is claimed on Form 8834, Credit for Increasing Research Activities, along with Schedule C, Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.\\n**Qualified research expenses.** To be considered a qualified research expense, the expense must be paid or incurred during the tax year and must be included in computing gross income. Examples of qualified research expenses include wages paid to employees performing research, salaries paid to contractors performing research, supplies used in research, equipment used in research, software used in research, and computer hardware used in research.\\n**Basic research and advanced research.** Basic research is defined as work undertaken to discover new laws of nature, develop new theories or models, solve complex problems, or test existing hypotheses.

These are certain drilling and development costs for wells in the United States in which you hold an operating or working interest. You can deduct only costs for drilling or preparing a well for the production of oil, gas, or geothermal steam or hot water.\\nYou can elect to deduct only the costs of items with no salvage value. These include wages, fuel, repairs, hailing, and supplies related to drilling wells and preparing them for production. Your cost for any drilling or development work done by contractors under any form of contract is also an IDC. However, see _Amounts paid to contractor that must be capitalized_.\\nYou can also elect to deduct the cost of drilling exploratory bore holes to determine the location and delineation of offshore hydrocarbon deposits if the shaft is capable of conducting hydrocarbons to the surface on completion. It does not matter whether there is any intent to produce hydrocarbons.\\nIf you do not elect to deduct your IDCs as a current business expense, you can elect to deduct them over the 60-month period beginning with the month they were paid or incurred.\\n**Amounts paid to contractor that must be capitalized.** Amounts paid to a contractor must be capitalized if they are either:\\n* Amounts properly allocable to the cost of appreciable property, or\\n* Amounts paid only out of production or proceeds from production if these amounts are depletable income to the recipient.\\n**How to make the election.** You elect to deduct IDCs as a current business expense by taking the deduction on your income tax return for the first tax year you have eligible costs. No formal statement is required. If you file Schedule C (Form 1040), enter these costs under \"Other expenses.\"\\nFor oil and gas wells, your election is binding for the year it is made and for all later years. For geothermal wells, your election can be revoked by the filing of an amended return on which you do not take the deduction. You can file the amended return for the year up to the normal time of expiration for filing a claim for credit or refund, generally, within 3 years after the date you filed the original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.\\n**Energy credit for costs of geothermal wells.** If you capitalize the drilling and development costs of geothermal wells that you place in service during the tax year, you may be able to claim a business energy credit. See the instructions for Form 3468 for more information.\\n**Nonproductive well.** If you capitalize your IDCs, you have another option if the well is nonproductive. You can deduct the IDCs of the nonproductive well as an ordinary loss. You must indicate and clearly state your election on your tax return for the year the well is completed. Once made, the election for oil and gas wells is binding for all later years. You can re-voke your election for a geothermal well by filing an amended return that does not claim the loss.\\n**Costs incurred outside the United States.** You cannot deduct as a current business expense all the IDCs paid or incurred for an oil, gas, or geothermal well located outside the United States. However, you can elect to include the costs in the adjusted basis of the well to figure depletion or depreciation. If you do not make this election, you can deduct the costs over the 10-year period beginning with the tax year in which you paid or incurred them. These rules do not apply to a nonproductive well.\\n**Tax treatment of IDCs paid to foreign contractors.** If you pay IDCs to a foreign contractor, you report the payments on Form W-8BEN-E, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for U.S. Tax Purposes. You do not need to report the payments on Form 1040 unless you are required to do so by other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n**Reporting requirements for IDCs paid to independent contractors.** If you pay IDCs to an independent contractor who has provided services to you in at least 200 hours during the calendar year, you must provide the contractor with a Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income Statement. You must also file Form 1099-MISC with the IRS.'],\n",

Development costs also include depreciation on improvements used in the development of cores or minerals and costs incurred for you by a contractor. Development costs do not include the costs for the acquisition or improvement of depreciable property.\\nInstead of deducting development costs in the year paid or incurred, you can elect to treat the costs as deferred expenses and deduct them actually as the units of produced ones or minerals benefited by the expenses are sold. This election applies each tax year to expenses paid or incurred in that year. Once made, the election is binding for the year and cannot be revoked for any reason.\\n**How to make the election.** The election to deduct development costs stably as the ones or minerals are sold must be made for each mine or other natural deposit by a clear indication on your return or by a statement filed with the IRS office where you file your return. Generally, you must make the election by the due date of the return (including extensions). However, if you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions).

For example, a publisher can deduct the cost of living extra employees for a limited time to get new subscriptions through telephone calls. Circulation costs may be deducted even if they would normally be capitalized.\\nThis rule does not apply to the following costs that must be capitalized.\\n* The purchase of land or depreciable property.\\n* The acquisition of circulation through the purchase of any part of the business of another publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical, including the purchase of another publisher's list of subscribers.\\n**Other treatment of circulation costs.** If you do not want to deduct circulation costs as a current business expense, you can elect one of the following ways to recover these costs.\\n* Capitalize all circulation costs that are properly chargeable to a capital account (see chapter.I).\\n* Amortize circulation costs over the 3-year period beginning with the tax year they were paid or incurred.\\n**How to make the election.** You elect to capitalize circulation costs by attaching a statement to your return for the first tax year the election applies. Your election is binding for the year it is made and for all later years, unless you get IRS approval to revoke it.\\n**Example.** Suppose you have $50,000 of circulation costs that you want to deduct as a current business expense. Instead of doing so, you choose to amortize them over three years. To calculate the amount you can deduct each year, divide $50,000 by 3.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Reforestation Costs\\nReforestation costs are generally capital expenditures. However, you can elect to deduct up to $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately, $50 for a trust) of qualifying reforestation costs paid or incurred after October 22, 2004, for each qualified timber property. The remaining costs can be amortized over an 84-month period. For information about amortizing reforestation costs, see chapter.8.\\nQualifying reforestation costs are the direct costs of planting or seeding for forestation or reforestation. Qualified timber property is property that contains trees in significant commercial quantities. See chapter.8 for more information on qualifying reforestation costs and qualified timber property.\\nIf you elect to deduct qualified reforestation costs, create and maintain separate timber accounts for each qualified timber property and include all reforestation costs and the dates each was applied. Do not include this qualified timber property in any account (for example, depletion block) for which depletion is allowed.\\n**How to make the election.** You elect to deduct qualifying reforestation costs by claiming the deduction on your timely filed income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year the expenses were paid or incurred. If Form 7 (Timber) is required, complete Part IV of the form. If Form 7 (Timber) is not required, attach a statement containing the following information for each qualified timber property for which an election is being made.\\n* The unique stand identification numbers.\\n* The total number of acres reforested during the tax year.\\n* The nature of the reforestation treatments.\\n* The total amounts of qualified reforestation expenditures eligible to be amortized or deducted.\\nIf you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Clearly indicate the election on your amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2.\" File the amended return at the same address you filed the original reforestation. The election applies when figuring taxable income for the current tax year and all subsequent years.\\nFor additional information on reforestation costs, see chapter 8.\\n**Recapure.** This deduction may have to be re-captured as ordinary income under section 1245 when you sell or otherwise disposes of the property that would have received an addition to basis if you had not elected to deduct the expenditure. For more information on recapturing the deduction, see _Deprecation Recapture_ in Pub. 544.\\n**Note:** Taxpayers who do not want to make the election should consult with their tax advisors before making any changes to their returns.'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## 7 Barrier Removal Costs\\nThe cost of an improvement to a business asset is normally a capital expense. However, you can elect to deduct the costs of making a facility or public transportation vehicle more accessible to and usable by those who are disabled or elderly. You must own or lease the facility or vehicle for use in connection with your trade or business.\\nA facility is all or any part of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or similar real or personal property. A public transportation vehicle is a vehicle, such as a bus or railroad car, that provides transportation service to the public (including service for your customers, even if you are not in the business of providing transportation services).\\nYou cannot deduct any costs that you paid or incurred to completely renovate or build a facility or public transportation vehicle or to replace appreciable property in the normal course of business.\\n**Deduction limit.** The most you can deduct as a cost of removing barriers to the disabled and the elderly for any tax year is $15,000. However, you can add any costs over this limit to the basis of the property and depreciate these excess costs.\\n**Partners and partnerships.** The $15,000 limit applies to a partnership and also to each partner in the partnership. A partner can allocate the $15,000 limit in any manner among the partners's individually incurred costs and the partner's distributive share of partnership costs. If the partner cannot deduct the entire share of partnership costs, the partnership can add any costs not deducted to the basis of the improved property.\\nA partnership must be able to show that any amount added to basis was not deducted by the partner and that it was over a partner's $15,000 limit (as determined by the partner). If the partnership cannot show this, it is presumed that the partner was able to deduct the distributivity share of the partnership's costs in full.\\n**Example.** Emilio Azui's distributive share of ABC partnerships deductible expenses for the removal of architectural barriers was $14,000. Emilio had $12,000 of similar expenses in his sole propriatorship. He elected to deduct $7,000 of them. Emilio allocated the remaining $8,000 of the $15,000 limit to his share of ABC's expenses. Emilio can add the excess $5,000 of his own expenses to the basis of the property used in his business. Also, if ABC can show that Emilio could not deduct $6,000 ($14,000 - $8,000) of his share of the partnership's expenses because of how Emilio applied the limit, ABC can add $6,000 to the basis of its property.\\n**Qualification standards.** You can deduct your costs as a current expense only if the barrier removal meets the guidelines and requirements issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. You can view the ADA at _ADA.gov/bubs/ ada.htm_.\\nThe following is a list of some architectural barrier removal costs that can be deducted.\\n* Ground and floor surfaces.\\n* Walks.\\n* Parking lots.\\n* Ramps.\\n* Entrances.\\n* Doors and doorways.\\n* Stairs.\\n* Floors.\\n* Toilet rooms.\\n* Water fountains.\\n* Public telephones.\\n* Elevators.\\n* Controls.\\n* Signage.\\n* Airarms.\\n* Protrutous objects.\\n* Symbols of accessibility.\\nYou can find the ADA guidelines and requirements for architectural barrier removal at _USDQ.gov/tradecalendar/ada-calendar_\"],\n",

See _Research and Experimental Costs_, later.\\n**Purchasing an active trade or business.** Amortizable startup costs for purchasing an active trade or business include only investigative costs incurred in the course of a general search for or preliminary investigation of the business. These are costs that help you decide whether to purchase a business. Costs you incur in an attempt to purchase a specific business are capital expenses that you can\\'t amortize.\\n_Example._ On June 1, you hired an accounting firm and a law firm to assist you in the potential purchase of XYZ, Inc. They researched XYZ\\'s industry and analyzed the financial projections of XYZ, Inc. In September, the law firm prepared and submitted a letter of intent to XYZ, Inc. The letter stated that a binding commitment would result only after a purchase agreement was signed. The law firm and accounting firm continued to provide services, including a review of XYZ\\'s books and records and the preparation of a purchase agreement. On October 22, you signed a purchase agreement with XYZ, Inc.\\nAll amounts paid or incurred to investigate the business before October 22 are amortizable in investigative costs. Amounts paid on or after that date relate to the attempt to purchase the business and therefore must be capitalized.\\n**Disposition of business.** If you completely dispose of your business before the end of the amortization period, you can deduct any remaining deferred startup costs. However, you can deduct these deferred startup costs only to the extent they qualify as a loss from a business. You cannot use them to offset income from another activity.\\nIf you sell all or part of your business during the amortization period, you can deduct the portion of the sale price that represents the unamortized portion of the qualifying costs. This amount is equal to the sum of the remaining deferred startup costs plus the portion of the sale price that represents the unamortized portion of the nonqualifying costs.\\nIf you transfer ownership of your business to another entity, such as a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, you can deduct the unamortized portion of the qualifying costs as a loss from a business.\\n**Electing Section 1.263(a)-3(n)**'],\n",

For more information, see the instructions for Part VI of Form 4562.\\nYou can choose to forgo the election to amortize by affirmatively electing to capitalize your startup or organizational costs on your income tax return filed by the due date (including extensions) for the tax year in which the active trade or business begins.\\n**Note.** The election to either amortize or capitalize startup or organizational costs is irrevocable and applies to all startup and organizational costs that are related to the trade or business.\\nIf your business is organized as a corporation or partnership, only the corporation or partnership can elect to amortize its startup or organizational costs. A shareholder or partner cant make this election. You, as a shareholder or partner, cant amortize any costs you incur in setting up your corporation or partnership. Only the corporation or partnership can amortize these costs.\\nHowever, you, as an individual, can elect to amortize costs you incur to investigate an interest in an existing partnership. These costs qualify as business startup costs if you acquire the partnership interest.\\n**Startup costs election statement.** If you elect to amortize your startup costs, attach a separate statement (if required) that contains the following information.\\n* A description of the business to which the startup costs relate.\\n* A description of each startup cost incurred.\\n* The month your active business began (or was acquired).\\n* The number of months in your amortization period (which is generally 180 months).\\n_Filing the statement early._ You can elect to amortize your startup costs by filing the statement with a return for any tax year before the year your active business begins. If you file the statement early, the election becomes effective in the month of the tax year your active business begins.\\n_Revised statement._ You can file a revised statement to include any startup costs not included in your original statement. However, you can't include on the revised statement any cost you previously treated on your return as a cost other than a startup cost. You can file the revised statement with a return filed after the return on which you elected to amortize your startup costs.\\n**Organizational costs election statement.** If you elect to amortize your corporation's or partnerships organizational costs, attach a separate statement (if required) that contains the following information.\\n* A description of each cost.\\n* The amount of each cost.\\n* The date each cost was incurred.\\n* The month your corporation or partnership began active business (or acquired the business).\\n* The number of months in your amortization period (which is generally 180 months).\\nWe can also consider the situation of the tax year, but it is not a cash basis.\\nIf you pay or incur an amount that increases the basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible after the 15-year period begins, amortize it over the remainder of the 15-year period beginning with the month the basis increase occurs.\\nYou aren't allowed any other depreciation or amortization deduction for an amortizable section 197 intangible.\\n**Tax-exempt use property subject to a lease.** The amortization period for any section 197 intangible leased under a lease agreement entered into after March 12, 2004, to a tax-exempt organization, governmental unit, or foreign person or entity (other than a partnership), shall not be less than 125% of the lease term.\\n**Cost attributable to other property.** The rules for section 197 intangibles dont apply to any amount that is included in determining the cost of property that isn't a section 197 intangible. For example, if the cost of computer software isn't separately stated from the cost of hardware or other tangible property and you consistently treat it as part of the cost of the hardware or other tangible property, these rules don't apply. Similarly, none of the cost of acquiring real property held for the production of rental income is considered the cost of good-will, going concern value, or any other section 197 intangible.\"],\n",

Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication (Shannon, 1948) establishing the theory of information. In his article, Shannon introduced the concept of information entropy for the first time. We will begin our journey here.\\nquestion: Question 1: Who published A Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1948?; Question 2: What concept did Shannon introduce in his 1948 article?; Question 3: What field was established by Shannon's 1948 publication?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Claude E. Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Section 197 Intangibles Defined\\nThe following assets are section 197 intangibles and must be amortized over 180 months.\\n1. Goodwill.\\n2. Going concern value.\\n3. Workforce in place.\\n4. Business books and records, operating systems, or any other information base, including lists or other information concerning current or prospective customers.\\n5. A patent, copyright, formula, process, design, pattern, know-how, format, or similar item.\\n6. A customer-based intangible.\\n7. A supplier-based intangible.\\n8. Any item similar to items 3 through 7.\\n9. A license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit or agency (including issuances and renewals).\\n10. A covenant not to compete entered into in connection with the acquisition of an interest in a trade or business.\\n11. Any franchise, trademark, or trade name.\\n12. A contract for the use of, or a term interest in, any item in this list.\\n_You can't amortize any of the intangibles listed in items 1 through 8 that you created rather than acquired unless you created them in acquiring assets that make up a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business._\\n**Goodwill.** This is the value of a trade or business based on expected continued customer patronage due to its name, reputation, or any other factor.\\n**Going concern value.** This is the additional value of a trade or business that attaches to property because the property is an integral part of an ongoing business activity. It includes value based on the ability of a business to continue to function and generate income even though there is a change in ownership (but doesn't include any other section 197 intangible). It also includes value based on the immediate use or availability of an acquired trade or business, such as the use of earnings during any period in which the business wouldn't otherwise be available or operational.\\n**Workforce in place, etc.** This includes the composition of a workforce (for example, its experience, education, or training). It also includes the terms and conditions of employment, whether contractual or otherwise, and any other value placed on employees or any of their attributes.\\nFor example, you must amortize the part of the purchase price of a business that is for the existence of a highly skilled workforce. Also, you must amortize the cost of acquiring an existing employment contract or relationship with employees or consultants.\\n**Business books and records, etc.** This includes the intangible value of technical manuals, training manuals or programs, data files, and accounting or inventory control systems. It also includes the cost of customer lists; subscription lists; insurance explanations; patient or client files; and lists of newspaper, magazine, radio, and television advertisers.\\n**Patents, copyrights, etc.** This includes package design, computer software, and any interest in a film, sound recording, videotape, book, or other similar property, except as discussed later under _Assets That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles._\\n**Customer-based intangible.** This is the composition of market, market share, and any other value resulting from the future provision of goods or services because of relationships with customers in the ordinary course of business. For example, you must amortize the part of the purchase price of a business that is for the existence of the following intangibles.\\n* A customer base.\\n* A circulation base.\\n* An undeveloped market or market growth.\\n* Insurance in force.\\n* A mortgage servicing contract.\\n* An investment management contract.\\n* Any other relationship with customers involving the future provision of goods or services.\\nAccounts receivable or other similar rights to income for goods or services provided to customers before the acquisition of a trade or business aren't section 197 intangibles.\\n**Supplier-based intangible.** A supplier-based intangible is the value resulting from the future acquisitions (through contract or other relationships with suppliers in the ordinary course of business) of goods or services that you will sell or use. The amount you pay or incur for supplier-based intangibles includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business that is attributable to the existence of a favorable relationship with persons providing distribution services (such as a favorable shelf of display space or a retail outlet), or the existence of favorable supply contracts. Don't include any amount required to be paid for the goods or services to honor the terms of the agreement or other relationship. Also, see _Asses That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles_, later.\\n**Government-granted license, permit, etc.** This is any right granted by a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmential unit. For example, you must amortize the capitalized costs of acquiring (including issuing or renewing) a liquor license, a taxicab metallion or license, or a television or radio broadcasting license.\\n**Covenant not to compete.** Section 197 intangibles include a covenant not to compete (or similar arrangement) entered into in connection with the acquisition of an interest in a trade or business, or a substantial portion of a trade or business. An interest in a trade or business includes an interest in a partnership or aporation engaged in a trade or business.\\nAn interest under either of the following.\\n1. An existing lease or sublease of tangible property.\\n2. A debt that was in existence when the interest was acquired.\\n3. A right to service residential mortgages unless the right is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business.\\n1. Certain transaction costs incurred by parties to a corporate organization or reorganization in which any part of a gain or loss isnt recognized.\\nIntangible property that isn't amorizable under the rules for section 197 intangibles can be depreciated if it meets certain requirements. You must generally use the straight line method over its useful life. For certain intangibles, the depreciation period is specified in the law and regulations. For example, the depreciation period for computer software that isn't a section 197 intangible is generally 36 months.\\nFor more information on depreciating intangible property, see _Intangible Property_ under _What Method Can You Use To Depreciate Your Property?_ in chapter 1 of Pub. 946.\\n**Contract for the use of, or a term interest in, a section 197 intangibles**\\n**A section 197 intangibles include any right under a license, contract, or other arrangement providing for the use of any section 197 intangible. It also includes any term interest in any section 197 intangible, whether the interest is outright or in trust.\\n**Assets That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles**\\nThe following assets aren't section 197 intangibles.\\n1. Any interest in a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate.\\n2. Any interest under an existing futures contract, foreign currency contract, notional principal contract, interest rate swap, or similar financial contract.\\n3. Any interest in land.\\n4. Most computer software. (See _Computer software_, later.)\\n5. Any of the following assets not acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business.\\n6. An interest in a film, sound recording, videotape, book, or similar property.\\n7. A right to receive tangible property or services under a contract or from a governmental agency.\\n8. An interest in a patent or copyright.\\n9. Certain rights that have a fixed duration or amount. (See _Bights of fixed duration or amount_, later.)\\n10. An interest under either of the following.\\n11. An existing lease or sublease of tangible property.\\n12. A debt that was in existence when the interest was acquired.\\n13. A right to service residential mortgages unless the right is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business.\\n14.

Software that meets all the following requirements.\\n1. It is, or has been, readily available for purchase by the general public.\\n2. It is subject to a nonexclusive license.\\n3. It hasn't been substantially modified. This requirement is considered met if the cost of all modifications isn't more than the greater of 25% of the price of the publicly available unmodified software or SS2,000.\\n2.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: #### Rights of fixed duration or amount\\nSection 197 intangibles don't include any right under a contract or from a governmental agency if the right is acquired in the ordinary course of a trade or business (or in an activity engaged in for the production of income) but not as part of a purchase of a trade or business and either:\\n* Has a fixed file of less than 15 years; or\\n* Is of a fixed amount that, except for the rules for section 197 intangibles, would be recovered under a method similar to the unit-of-production method of cost recovery.\\nHowever, this doesn't apply to the following intangibles.\\n* Goodwill.\\n* Going concern value.\\n* A covenant not to compete.\\n* A franchise, trademark, or trade name.\\n* A customer-related information base, customer-based intangible, or similar item.\\n* Any other intangible asset that has a finite life.\\n##### Exceptions\\nExcept for goodwill, going concern value, and a covenant not to compete, all rights under a contract or from a governmental agency are included in the definition of Section 197 intangibles.\\n###### Example\\nExample 1: If a company sells its inventory at fair market value, it recognizes gain equal to the difference between the selling price and the original acquisition price. This is because the inventory is considered to have a finite life and is therefore subject to depreciation over its useful life. However, if the company sells its inventory at above fair market value, it does not recognize gain until the inventory is sold at arm's length.\\n### Tax treatment of intangibles\\nIntangibles with a finite life are taxed like property when they are disposed of. Intangibles without a finite life are taxed like personal property when they are disposed of.\\n###### Example\\nExample 2: If a company sells its patents for $10 million, it recognizes gain equal to $10 million minus the original acquisition price. Since patents have a finite life, they are taxed like property when they are disposed of. On the other hand, if a company sells its copyrights for $10 million, it recognizes gain equal to $10 million minus the original acquisition price. Copyrights do not have a finite life, so they are taxed like personal property when they are disposed of.\"],\n",

You may amortize these costs rationally over a 15-year period beginning on the first day of the second half of the tax year in which you properly write off the costs for financial accounting purposes. If, during the 15-year period, you dispose of the creative property rights, you must continue to amortize the costs over the remainder of the 15-year period.\\nCreative property costs include costs paid or incurred to acquire and develop screenplays, scripts, story outlines, motion picture production rights to books and plays, and other similar properties for purposes of potential future film development, production, and exploitation.\\nAmortize these costs using the rules of Revenue Procedure 2004-36. For more information, see Revenue Procedure 2004-36, 2004-24 I.R.B. 1063, available at _IRS.gov/lib/2004-24 I.R.B.#P-2004-36_.\\nA change in the treatment of creative property costs is a change in method of accounting.\\nThe grantor and fiduciary, and the fiduciary and beneficiary, of any trust.\\nThe fiduciaries of two different trusts, and then fiduciaries and beneficiaries of two different trusts, if the same person is the grantor of both trusts.\\nThe executor and beneficiary of an estate.\\nA tax-exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls the organization (or whose family members control it).\\nA corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 20% of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than 20% of the capital or profits interest in the partnership.\\nTwo S corporations, and an S corporation and a regular corporation, if the same persons own more than 20% of the value of the outstanding stock of each corporation.\\nTwo partnerships if the same persons own, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in both partnerships.\\nA partnership and a person who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the credit or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or indirectly, more than 20% of the capital or profits interests in the partnership.\\nTwo persons who are engaged in trades or businesses under common control (as described in section 41(f)(1)).\\nAn individual and a foreign entity with which such individual has a covered relationship as defined in section 721(c), 721(d), 721(e), 721(g), 721(h), 721(i), 721(j), 721(k), 721(l), 721(m), 721(n), 721(o), 721(p), 721(q), 721(r), 721(s), 721(t), 721(u), 721(v), 721(w), 721(x), 721(y), 721(z), 721(aa), 721(bb), 721(cc), 721(dd), 721(ee), 721(ff), 721(gg), 721(hh), 721(ii), 721(jj), 721(kk), 721(ll), 721(mm), 721(nn), 721(oo), 721(pp), 721(qq), 721(rr), 721(ss), 721(tt), 721(uu), 721(vv), 721(ww), 721(xx), 721(yy), 721(zz), 721(aaaa), 721(bbbb), 721(cccc), 721(dddd), 721(eeee), 721(ffff), 721(gggg), 721(hhhh), 721(iii), 721(jjj), 721(kkk), 721(lll), 721(mmm), 721(nnn), 721(oooo), 721(ppp), 721(qqq), 721(rrr), 721(sss), 721(ttt), 721(uuu), 721(vvv), 721(www), 721(xxx), 721(yyy), 721(zzz), 721(aaaaa), 721(bbbbb), 721(ccccc), 721(ddddd), 721(eeeee), 721(fffff), 721(ggggg), 721(hhhhh), 721(iii\"],\n",

To determine whether two persons have a relationship, you need to consider the timing of their interactions with each other. If they interacted during a single transaction, then they may be considered related if the relationship existed immediately before or immediately after the transaction. If they interacted over a series of transactions, then they may be considered related if the relationship existed immediately before the earliest transaction or immediately after the last transaction. Similarly, if one person acquired an intangible asset from another through an exchange, then they may be considered related if the relationship existed immediately before or immediately after the exchange. Finally, if one person sold an intangible asset to another, then they may be considered related if the relationship existed immediately before or immediately after the sale.\"],\n",

If you held the intangible for more than 1 year, any gain on its disposition, up to the amount of allowable amortization, is ordinary income (section 1245 gain). If multiple section 197 intangibles are exposed of in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, treat all of the section 197 intangibles as if they were a single asset for purposes of determining the amount of gain that is ordinary income. Any remaining gain, or any loss, is a section 1231 gain or loss. If you held the intangible 1 year or less, any gain or loss on its disposition is an ordinary gain or loss. For more information on ordinary or capital gain or loss on business property, see chapter 3 of Pub. 544.\\nquestion: Question 1: How long must a section 197 intangible be held before it becomes taxed as ordinary income?; Question 2: What happens to any remaining gain or loss when a section 197 intangible is sold?; Question 3: Is there a specific tax treatment for gains or losses from the sale of a section 197 intangible within one year of being acquired?\\nanswer: Answer 1: A section 197 intangible must be held for more than 1 year before it becomes taxed as ordinary income.; Answer 2: Any remaining gain or loss is a section 1231 gain or loss.; Answer 3: No, there is no specific tax treatment for gains or losses from the sale of a section 197 intangible within one year of being acquired.\"],\n",

Instead, increase the adjusted basis of each remaining amortizable section 197 intangible by a proportionate part of the nonducuctible loss. Figure the increase by multiplying the nonductible loss on the disposition of the intangible by the following fraction.\\n* The numerator is the adjusted basis of each remaining intangle on the date of the disposition.\\n* The denominator is the total adjusted basis of all remaining amortizable section 197 intangibles on the date of the disposition.\\nquestion: Question 1: How does one calculate the induction loss? ; question 2: Is it possible to deduct any loss on the disposition or worthlessness of an acquired section 197 intangible? ; question 3: How is the induced loss calculated? ;\\nanswer: Answer 1: To calculate the induction loss, figure out the difference between the adjusted basis of the disposed-of intangible and the adjusted basis of the remaining intangibles. Multiply this amount by the ratio of the adjusted basis of the disposed-of intangible to the total adjusted basis of all remaining intangibles. Then divide this result by the number of remaining intangibles. Answer 2: No, it is not possible to deduct any loss on the disposition or worthlessness of an acquired section 197 intangible. Answer 3: The induced loss is calculated by figuring out the difference between the adjusted basis of the disposed-of intangible and the adjusted basis of the remaining intangibles. Multiply this amount by the ratio of the adjusted basis of the disposed-of intangible to the total adjusted basis of all remaining intangibles.

You amortize this part of the adjusted basis over the intangible's remaining amortization period in the hands of the transferor. Nonrecognition transfers include transfers to a corporation, partnership contributions and distributions, like-kind exchanges, and involuntary conversions.\\nIn a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of a section 197 intangible, you must continue to amortize the part of your adjusted basis in the acquired intangible that isn't more than your adjusted basis in the exchanged or converted intangible over the remaining amortization period of the exchanged or converted intangible. Amortize over a new 15-year period the part of your adjusted basis in the acquired intangible that is more than your adjusted basis in the exchanged or converted intangible.\\nExample.You own a section 197 intangible you have amortized for 4 full years. It has a remaining amortized basis of 50,000 for a like-kind exchange in system 197 intangible. The nonrecognition provisions of like-kind exchanges apply. You amortize 530,000 of the 540,000 adjusted basis of the acquired intangible over the 11 years remaining in the original 15-year amortization period for the transferred asset. You amortize the other 510,000 of adjusted basis over a new 15-year period. For more information, see Regulations section 1.197-2(g).\\nquestion: Question 1: When does a covenant not to compete become worthless? ; Question 2: How do I calculate my adjusted basis in an acquired intangible after a nonrecognition transfer? ; Question 3: What happens if I engage in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of a section 197 intangible?\"],\n",

See _Reforestation Costs_ in chapter 1.7_. You can elect to amortize the qualifying costs that aren\\'t deducted currently over an 84-month period. There is no limit on the amount of your amortization deduction for reforestation costs paid or incurred during the tax year.\\nThe election to amortize reforestation costs incurred by a partnership, S Corporation, or estimate must be made by the partnership, copporation, or estate. A partner, shareholder, or beneficiary can\\'t make that election.\\nA partner\\'s or shareholder\\'s share of amorizable costs is figured under the general rules for allocating items of income, loss, deduction, etc., of a partnership or S Corporation. The amorizable costs of an estate are divided between the estate and the income beneficiary based on the income of the estate allocable to each.\\nQualifying costs.Reforestation costs are the direct costs of planting or seeding for forestation or reforestation. Qualifying costs include only those costs you must capitalize and include in the adjusted basis of the property. They include costs for the following items.\\n* Site preparation.\\n* Seeds or seedlings.\\n* Labor.\\n* Tools.\\n* Depreciation on equipment used in planting and seeding.\\nQualifying costs don\\'t include costs for which the government reimburses you under a cost-sharing program, unless you include the reimbursement in your income.\\nQualified timber property.Qualified timber property property is property that contains trees in significant commercial quantities. It can be a woodoid or other site but you own or lease. The property qualifies only if it meets all of the following requirements.\\n* Its located in the United States.\\n* It is held for the growing and cutting of timber you will use in, or self for use in, the commercial production of timber products.\\n* It consists of at least one arc planted with tree seedlings in the manner normally used in forestation or reforestation.\\nQualified timber property doesn\\'t include property on which you have planted shelter belts or ornamental trees, such as Christmas trees.\\nAmortization period.The 84-month amortization period starts on the first day of the first month of the second half of the tax year you incur the costs (July 1 for a calendar year tax-paper), regardless of the month you actually incur the costs. You can claim amortization deductions for no more than 6 months of the first and last (github) tax years of the period.\\nLife tenant and remainderan.If one person holds the property for life with the remainder going to another person, the life tenant is entitled to the full amortization for qualifying reforestation costs incurred by the life tenant. Any remainder interest in the property is ignored for amortization purposes.\\nRecapure.If you dispose of qualified timber property within 10 years after the tax year you incur qualifying reforestation expenses, report any gain as ordinary income up to the amortization you took. See chapter 3 of Pub. 544 for more information.\\nHow to make the election.To elect to amortize qualifying reforestation costs, complete Part VI of Form 4562 and attach a statement that contains the following information.\\n* A description of the costs and the dates you incur incurred them.\\n* A description of the type of timber being grown and the purpose for which it is grown.\\nAttach a separate statement for each property for which you amortize rotorestation costs.\\nGenerally, you must make the election on a timely filed return (including extensions) for the tax year in which you incurred the costs. However, if you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Attach Form 4562 and the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" on Form 4562. File the amended return at the same address you filed the original return.\\nRevoking the election.You must get IRS approval to revoke your election to amortize qualifying reforestation costs. Your application to revoke the election must include your name, address, the years for which your election was in effect, and your reason for revoking it. Provided your daytime telephone number (optional), in case we need to contact you. You, or your duty authorized representative, must sign the application and file it at least 90 days before the due date (without extensions) for filing your income tax return for the first tax year for which your election is to end.\\nThe facility must not significantly increase the output or capacity, extend the useful life, or reduce the total operating costs of the plant or other property. Also, it must not significantly change the nature of the manufacturing or production process or facility.\\nThe federal certifying authority won\\'t certify your property to the extent it appears you will recover (over the property\\'s useful life) all or part of its cost from the profit based on its operation (such as through sales of recovered wastes). The federal certifying authority will describe the nature of the potential cost recovery. You must then reduce the amortizable basis of the facility by this potential recovery.\\nNew identifiable treatment facility.A new identifiable treatment facility is tangible de-preciable property that is identifiable as a treatment facility. It doesn\\'t include a building and its structural components unless the building is exclusively a treatment facility.\\nAtmospheric pollution control facilities.Certain atmospheric pollution control facilities can be amortized over 84 months. To qualify, the following must apply.\\n* The facility must be acquired and placed in service after April 11, 2005. If acquired, the original use must begin with you after April 11, 2005.\\n* The facility must be used in connection with an electric generation plant or other property placed in operation after December 31, 1975, that is primarily coal fired.\\n* If you construct, reconstruct, or erect the facility, only the basis attributable to the construction, reconstruction, or excretion completed after April 11, 2005, qualifies.\\nBasis reduction for corporations.A corporation must reduce the amortizable basis of a pollution control facility by 20% before figuring the amortization deduction.\\nMore information.For more information on the amortization of pollution control facilities, see sections 169 and 291(c) and the related regulations. For more information on the certification of identifiable treatment facilities, see section 169(a)(1) and the related regulations.'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Introduction\\nDepletion is the using up of natural resources extracted from a mineral property by mining, drilling, quanying stone, or cutting timber. The depletion deduction allows an owner or operator to account for the reduction of the mineral property/s value or basis as a result of the extraction of the natural resource.\\nThere are two ways of figuring depletion: cost depletion and percentage depletion. For oil and gas wells, mines, other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits), and mineral property, you must generally use the method that gives you the larger deduction. For standing timber, you must use cost depletion.\\n### Cost Depletion\\nCost depletion is used when the cost of extracting the natural resource exceeds the amount of the resource extracted. This means that the cost of extracting the resource is higher than its market value.\\nThe formula for calculating cost depletion is:\\nDeduction = (Total Cost - Total Revenue) / Number of Years\\nwhere Total Cost is the total cost of extracting the resource over the life of the mine, Total Revenue is the total revenue received from selling the resource during the same period, and Number of Years is the number of years it takes to extract all of the resource.\\n### Percentage Depletion\\nPercentage depletion is used when the cost of extracting the natural resource is less than the amount of the resource extracted. This means that the cost of extracting the resource is lower than its market value.\\nThe formula for calculating percentage depletion is:\\nDeduction = (Total Cost - Total Revenue) x (Number of Years / Extraction Period)\\nwhere Total Cost is the total cost of extracting the resource over the life of the mine, Total Revenue is the total revenue received from selling the resource during the same period, Number of Years is the number of years it takes to extract all of the resource, and Extraction Period is the average length of time it takes to extract one unit of the resource.\\nIn summary, depletion is the process of using up natural resources extracted from a mineral property through mining, drilling, quarrying stone, or cutting timber. There are two methods of figuring depletion: cost depletion and percentage depletion. The choice between these two methods depends on whether the cost of extracting the resource exceeds the amount of the resource extracted or if the cost of extracting the resource is less than the amount of the resource extracted.\"],\n",

It occurs because these activities are not always available due to factors such as weather conditions or equipment breakdowns. This can lead to lost revenue and productivity. To mitigate this risk, it is important to have contingency plans in place. These plans should include alternative activities that can be used if the primary activity becomes unavailable. Additionally, regular maintenance and repairs should be performed on equipment to prevent unexpected downtime. Finally, insurance coverage can help protect against financial losses caused by passive activity limitations.\"],\n",

Your adjusted basis can never be less than zero. See Pub. 551 for more information on adjusted basis.\\nTotal recoverable units.The total recoverable units is the sum of the following.\\n* The number of units of mineral remaining at the end of the year (including units recovered but not sold).\\n* The number of units of mineral sold during the tax year (determined under your method of accounting, as explained next).\\nYou must estimate or determine recoverable units (tons, pounds, ounces, barrels, thousands of cubic feet, or other measure) of mineral products using the current industry method and the most accurate and reliable information you can obtain. You must include ores and minerals that are developed, in sight, blocked out, or assured. You must also include probable or prospective ores or minerals that are believed to exist based on good evidence. But see _Electric safe harbor for owners of oil and gas property_, later.\\nNumber of units sold during the tax year.You determine the number of units sold during the tax year based on your method of accounting.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Figuring percentage depletion.\\nGenerally, as an independent producer or royalty owner, you figure your percentage depletion by figuring your average daily production of domestic oil or gas and comparing it to your depletable oil or gas quantity. If your average daily production does not exceed your depletable oil or gas quantity, you figure your percentage depletion by multiplying the gross income from the oil or gas property (as defined under _Gross income from the property_, later) by 15% (0.15). If your average daily production of domestic oil or gas exceeds your depletable oil or gas quantity, you must make an allocation as explained later under _Average daily production_.\\nIn addition, there is a limit on the percentage depletion deduction. See _Taxable income limit_, later.\\n**Average daily production.** Figure your average daily production by dividing your total domestic production of oil or gas for the tax year by the number of days in your tax year.\\n**Partial interest.** If you have a partial interest in the production from a property, figure your share of the production by multiplying total production from the property by your percentage participation in the revenues from the property.\\nYou have a partial interest in the production from a property if you have a net profits interest in the property. To figure the share of production for your net profits interest, you must first determine your percentage participation (as measured by the net profits) in the gross revenue from the property. To figure this percentage, you divide the income you receive for your net profits interest by the gross revenue from the property. Then multiply the total production from the property by your percentage participation to figure your share of the production.\\n**Example.** Riley owns oil property in which Finley owns a 20% net profits interest. During the year, the property produced 10,000 barrels of oil, which Riley sold for $200,000. Riley had expenses of $90,000 attributable to the property. The property generated a net profit of $110,000 ($200,000 - $900,000). Finley received income of $22,000 ($110,000 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 20% (0.20)) as Finley\\'s net profits interest.\\nThe percentage participation that Finley determined was 11%, figured by dividing $22,000 (income received) by $200,000 (the gross revenue from the property). Finley\\'s share of the oil production was determined to be 1,100 barrels (10,000 barrels \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 11% (0.11)).\\n**Depitelable oil or natural gas quantity.** Generally, your depletable oil quantity is 1,000 barrels. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of your depletable oil quantity that you choose to apply. If you claim depletion on both oil and natural gas, you must reduce your depletable oil quantity (1,000 barrels) by the number of barrels you use to figure your depletable natural gas quantity.\\n**Example.** You have both oil and natural gas production. To figure your depletable natural gas quantity, you choose to apply 360 barrels of your depletable oil quantity. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 2.16 million cubic feet of gas (360 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 6,000). You must reduce your depletable oil quantity to 640 barrels (1,000 - 360).\\nIf you have production from marginal walls, see section 613A(c)(6) to figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. See also Notice 2022-24, available at _HS.gov/info/2022-21 IRB_.\\n**Business entities and family members.** You must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in proportion to each business entity\\'s or family member\\'s production of domestic oil or gas for the year.\\n* Corporations, trusts, and states if 50% or more of the beneficial interest is owned by the same or related persons (considering only persons that own at least 5% of the beneficial interest).\\n* You and your spouse and minor children.\\n* A related person is anyone mentioned in the related persons discussion under _Nondeductible loss_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for purposes of this allocation, item (1) in that discussion includes only an individual, spouse, and their minor children.\\n**Controlled group of corporations.** Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one taxpayer when figuring the depletable oil or natural gas quantity. They share the depletable quantity. A controlled group of corporations is defined in section 1563(a), except that, for this purpose, the stock ownership requirement is \"more than 50%\" rather than \"at least 80%,\" as described in section 1563(a).\\n**Gross income from the property.** For purposes of percentage depletion, gross income from the property (in the case of oil and gas wells) is the amount you receive from the sale of the oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well. If you do not sell the oil or gas on the property but manufacture or convert it into a refined product before sale, or transport it before sale, the gross income from the property is the representative market or field price (RMPP) of the oil or gas before conversion or transportation.\\nHowever, if you sold gas after you transported it from the premises for a price that is lower than the RMPP, determine gross income from the property for percentage depletion purposes without regard to the RMPP.\\nGross income from the property does not include lease bonuses, advance royalties, or other amounts payable without regard to production from the property.\\n**Average daily production exceeds depletable quantities. If your average daily production for the year is more than your depletable oil or natural gas quantity, figure your allowance for depletion for each domestic oil or natural gas property as follows.**\\n1. **Figure your average daily production of oil or natural gas for the year.**\\n2. **Figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. To figure your depletable natural gas quantity, you choose to apply 360 barrels of your depletable oil quantity. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 2.16 million cubic feet of gas (360 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 6,000). You must reduce your depletable oil quantity to 640 barrels (1,000 - 360).**\\nIf you have production from marginal walls, see section 613A(c)(6) to figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. See also Notice 2022-24, available at _HS.gov/info/2022-21 IRB_.\\n**Business entities and family members.** You must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in proportion to each business entity\\'s or family member\\'s production of domestic oil or gas for the year.\\n* Corporations, trusts, and states if 50% or more of the beneficial interest is owned by the same or related persons (considering only persons that own at least 5% of the beneficial interest).\\n* You and your spouse and minor children.\\n* A related person is anyone mentioned in the related persons discussion under _Nondeductible loss_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for purposes of this allocation, item (1) in that discussion includes only an individual, spouse, and their minor children.\\n**Controlled group of corporations.** Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one taxpayer when figuring the depletable oil or natural gas quantity. They share the depletable quantity. A controlled group of corporations is defined in section 1563(a), except that, for this purpose, the stock ownership requirement is \"more than 50%\" rather than \"at least 80%,\" as described in section 1563(a).\\n**Gross income from the property.** For purposes of percentage depletion, gross income from the property (in the case of oil and gas wells) is the amount you receive from the sale of the oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well. If you do not sell the oil or gas on the property but manufacture or convert it into a refined product before sale, or transport it before sale, the gross income from the property is the representative market or field price (RMPP) of the oil or gas before conversion or transportation.\\nHowever, if you sold gas after you transported it from the premises for a price that is lower than the RMPP, determine gross income from the property for percentage depletion purposes without regard to the RMPP.\\n**Partner\\'s or shareholder\\'s adjusted basis.** The partnership or S corporation must allocate to each partner or shareholder its share of the adjusted basis of each oil or gas property held by the partnership or S corporation. The partnership or S corporation makes the allocation as of the date it acquires the oil or gas property.\\nEach member\\'s share of the adjusted basis of the oil or gas property is generally figured according to that partner\\'s interest in partnership capital. However, in some cases, it is figured according to the partner\\'s interest in partnership income.\\nThe partnership or S corporation adjusts the partners or shareholder\\'s share of the adjusted basis of the oil and gas property for any capital expenditures made for the property and for any change in partnership or S corporation interests.\\n**Recordkeeping.** Each partner or shareholder must separately keep records of its share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the partnership or S corporation. The partner or shareholder must reduce its applicable adjusted basis by the depletion allowed or allowable on the property each year. The partner or shareholder must use that reduced adjusted basis to figure cost depletion, or its gain or loss, if the partnership or S corporation disposes of the property.\\n**Reporting the deduction.** Information that you, as a partner or shareholder, use to figure your depletion deduction on oil and gas properties is reported by the partnership or S corporation on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or on Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S). Deduct oil and gas depletion for your partnership or S Corporation interest on Schedule E (Form 1040). The depletion conducted on Schedule E is included in figuring income or loss from rental real estate or royalty properties. The instructions for Schedule E (Form 1040) explain where to report this income or loss and whether you need to file either of the following forms.\\n* Form 6198.\\n* Form 8582.\\n**Taxable income limit.** There is a limit on the percentage depletion deduction. This limit applies to all types of oil and gas properties. It is calculated as 75% of the gross income from the property minus the sum of the following items:\\n* Lease bonus payments.\\n* Advance royalties paid.\\n* Other amounts payable without regard to production from the property.\\nTo calculate the taxable income limit, follow these steps:\\n1. Determine the gross income from the property.\\n2. Subtract lease bonus payments, advance royalties, and other amounts payable without regard to production from the property.\\n3. Multiply the result by 0.75.\\nThe taxable income limit is used to determine the maximum amount of depreciation expense that can be claimed as a deduction against the gross income from the property. Any excess depreciation expense is carried forward to future years.\\n**Example.** Riley owns oil property in which Finley owns a 20% net profits interest. During the year, the property produced 10,000 barrels of oil, which Riley sold for $200,000. Riley had expenses of $90,000 attributable to the property. The property generated a net profit of $110,000 ($200,000 - $900,000). Finley received income of $22,000 ($110,000 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 20% (0.20)) as Finley\\'s net profits interest.\\nThe percentage participation that Finley determined was 11%, figured by dividing $22,000 (income received) by $200,000 (gross revenue from the property). Finley\\'s share of the oil production was determined to be 1,100 barrels (10,000 barrels \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 11% (0.11)).\\n**Depletable oil or natural gas quantity.** Generally, your depletable oil quantity is 1,000 barrels. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of your depletable oil quantity that you choose to apply. If you claim depletion on both oil and natural gas, you must reduce your depletable oil quantity (1,000 barrels) by the number of barrels you use to figure your depletable natural gas quantity.\\n**Business entities and family members.** You must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in proportion to each business entity\\'s or family member\\'s production of domestic oil or gas for the year.\\n* Corporations, trusts, and states if 50% or more of the beneficial interest is owned by the same or related persons (considering only persons that own at least 5% of the beneficial interest).\\n* You and your spouse and minor children.\\n* A related person is anyone mentioned in the related persons discussion under _Nondeductible loss_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for purposes of this allocation, item (1) in that discussion includes only an individual, spouse, and their minor children.\\n**Controlled group of corporations.** Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one taxpayer when figuring the depletable oil or natural gas quantity.

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Fiquing percentage depletion\\nIn the case of mines, wells, and other natural deposits other than gas, oil, or geothermal property, you may use the percentage rates discussed earlier under _Mines and Geothermal Deposits_. Any bonus or advanced royalty payments are generally part of the gross income from the property to which the rates are applied in making the calculation. However, for oil, gas, or geothermal property, gross income does not include lease pronuses, advanced royalties, or other amounts payable without regard to production from the property.\\n_Ending the lease._ If you receive a bonus on a lease that ends or is abandoned before you derive any income from mineral extraction or the cutting of timber, include in income the depletion deduction you took on the bonus. Do this for the year the lease ends or is abandoned. Also, increase your adjusted basis in the property to restore the depletion deduction you previously subtracted.\\nFor advanced royalties, include in income the depletion claimed on minerals or timber for which the advanced royalties were paid, if the minerals were not produced or timber not cut before the lease ended. Include this amount in income for the year the lease ends. Increase your adjusted basis in the property by the amount you include in income.\\n**Delay rentals.** These are payments for deferring development of the property. Since delay rentals are ordinary rentals are ordinary rentals we are ordinary income to the paye that is not subject to depletion. These rentals can be avoided by either abandoning the lease, beginning development operations, or obtaining production.\\n_Adjustment to basis at end of lease._ At the end of the lease, adjust your adjusted basis in the property to reflect the depletion expense you have taken during the life of the lease. This adjustment is made only if you derived no income from the property during the lease period.\\n_Adjustment to basis after sale._ If you sell the property before it has been fully depleted, you must take an adjustment to your basis to account for the undepleted portion of the property. You do this by multiplying the difference between the selling price and the original purchase price by the ratio of the remaining reserve to the total reserve as determined by the depletion method used.\\n_Depletion methods._ There are two commonly used depletion methods: the straight-line method and the sum-of-the-years' digits method. Both methods require estimates of the total reserves and the rate of depletion.\\n_Straight-line method._ Under the straight-line method, the depletion expense is calculated by dividing the total reserves by the number of years over which they are expected to be consumed. For example, if the estimated reserves are 50 million barrels and the expected consumption rate is 1 million barrels per year, the depletion expense would be $1 million per year.\\n_Sum-of-the-years' digits method._ Under the sum-of-the-years' digits method, the depletion expense is calculated by taking the square root of the number of years over which the reserves are expected to be consumed. For example, if the estimated reserves are 50 million barrels and the expected consumption rate is 1 million barrels per year, the depletion expense would be approximately $706,000 per year.\\n_Example._ Suppose you own a mine with an estimated reserve of 10 million tons of coal and expect to extract 1 million tons per year. Using the straight-line method, the depletion expense would be $1 million per year ($10 million / 10 years). Using the sum-of-the-years' digits method, the depletion expense would be approximately $706,000 per year ($\\\\sqrt{10}$).\\nquestion: Question 1: When should I include depletion deductions in my income? ; Question 2: How do I calculate the depletion expense using the straight-line method? ; Question 3: Which depletion method should I use when calculating the depletion expense?\"],\n",

Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication (Shannon, 1948) establishing the theory of information. In his article, Shannon introduced the concept of information entropy for the first time. We will begin our journey here.\\nquestion: Question 1: Who published A Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1948?; Question 2: What concept did Shannon introduce in his 1948 article?; Question 3: What field was established by Shannon\\'s 1948 publication?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Claude E. Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## 4 Timber\\nYou can figure timber depletion only by the cost method. Percentage depletion does not apply to timber. Base your depletion on your cost or other basis in the timber. Your cost does not include the cost of land or any amounts recoverable through depreciation.\\nDepletion takes place when you cut standing timber. You can figure your depletion deduction when the quantity of cut timber is first accurately measured in the process of exploitation.\\n**Figuring cost depletion.** To figure your cost depletion allowance, you multiply the number of timber units cut by your depletion unit.\\n_Timber units._ When you acquire timber property, you must make an estimate of the quantity of marketable timber reasonably known, or on good evidence believed to exist on the property. You measure the timber using feet board measure (FBM), log scale, cords, or other units. If you later determine that you have more or less units of timber, you must adjust the original estimate.\\nThe term \"timber property\" means your economic interest in standing timber in each tract or block representing a separate timber account.\\n_Depletion unit._ You figure your depletion unit each year by taking the following steps.\\n1. Determine your cost or adjusted basis of the timber on hand at the beginning of the year. Adjusted basis is defined under _Cost Depletion_ in the discussion on _Mineral Property_, earlier.\\n2. Add to the amount determined in (1) the cost of any timber units acquired during the year and any additions to capital.\\n3. Figure the number of timber units to take into account by adding the number of timber units acquired during the year to the number of timber units on hand in the account at the beginning of the year and then adding (or subtracting) any correction to the estimate of the number of timber units remaining in the account.\\n4. Divide the result of (2) by the result of (3). This is your depletion unit.\\n_Example._ You bought a timber tract for $160,000 and the land was worth as much as the timber. Your basis for the timber is $80,000. Based on an estimated 1 million feet board measure (FBM) or 1,000 \"thousand board feet\" (MFBM) of standing timber, you figure your depletion unit to be $80 per MFBM ($80,000 + 1,000). If you cut 500 MFBM of timber, your depletion allowance would be $40,000 (500 \\\\(\\\\mathrm{MFBM}\\\\times\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\mathrm{0}\\\\)).\\n**When to claim depletion.** Claim your depletion allowance as a deduction in the year of sale or other disposition of the products cut from the timber, unless you choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange (explained below). Include allowable depletion for timber products not sold during the tax year the timber is cut as a cost item in the closing inventory of timber products for the year. The inventory is your basis for determining gain or loss in the tax year you sell the timber products.\\n_Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you seldom only half of the timber products in the cutting year. You would deduct $20,000 of the $40,000 depletion that year. You would add the remaining $20,000 depletion to your closing inventory of timber products.\\n**Electing to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange.** You can elect, under certain circumstances, to treat the cutting of timber held for more than 1 year as a sale or exchange. You must make the election on your income tax return for the tax year to which it applies. The election can\\'t be made on an amended return. If you make this election, subtract the adjusted basis for depletion from the fair market value (FBM) of the timber on the first day of the tax year in which you cut it to figure the gain or loss on the cutting. You generally report the gain as long-term capital gain. The FBM then becomes your basis for figuring your ordinary gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of the products cut from the timber. For more information, see _Timber_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544.\\nYou may revoke an election to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, without the IRS\\'s consent, by the due (including extensions) for the return. The prior election (and revocation) is disregarded for purposes of making a subsequent election. See Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule) for more information.\\n**Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule).** Complete and attach Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule) to your income tax return if you claim a deduction for timber depletion, choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, or make an outright sale of timber. Form T provides instructions for completing the form and calculating the depletion allowance.\\n_Note._ Form T is available from the IRS website (www.irs.gov/pubformspubs/aboutpubforms.asp?cpage=7&cp=1459,1460&type=all&subtype=all&topic=all&start=yes&keywords=form+t) or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-4036).'],\n",

These debts can be classified into two categories: short-term and long-term. Short-term business bad debts are usually paid off within one year, while long-term business bad debts may take several years to repay.\\n### 5.2 Causes\\nThere are various causes of business bad debts, including poor cash flow management, overproduction, underestimation of market demand, mismanagement of inventory, and lack of proper accounting practices. Other factors such as economic downturns, changes in interest rates, and unexpected expenses can also contribute to the accumulation of business bad debts.\\n### 5.3 Effects\\nThe effects of business bad debts can be severe, leading to financial instability, bankruptcy, and even closure of the business. To avoid these negative consequences, it is important for businesses to manage their finances carefully and implement effective debt reduction strategies.\\n### 5.4 Solutions\\nEffective solutions to business bad debts include negotiating with creditors, refinancing loans, selling assets, and implementing cost-cutting measures. It is also essential for businesses to have accurate financial records and develop a comprehensive budget plan to prevent future instances of bad debts.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Introduction\\nYou have a bad debt if you cannot collect money owed to you. A bad debt is either a business bad debt or a nonbusiness bad debt. This chapter discusses only business bad debts.\\nGenerally, a business bad debt is one that comes from operating your trade or business. You can deduct business bad debts on Scheduled C (Form 1040) or your applicable business income tax return.\\nAll other bad debts are nonbusiness bad debts and are deductible only as short-term capital losses. For more information on nonbusiness bad debts, see Pub. 550.\\n### Deduction of Business Bad Debts\\nIf you owe money to someone who provided goods or services to your business, you may be able to deduct the amount you owe as a business expense. However, there are certain rules you must follow to qualify for this deduction.\\nOne rule is that you must report the payment of the debt on Form 1040. If you do not report the payment, you cannot claim the deduction.\\nAnother rule is that you must pay the debt within 365 days after the end of the year in which you received the goods or services. If you fail to pay the debt within this time frame, it becomes a bad debt and you cannot claim the deduction.\\nIn addition, you must also provide proof of payment. This means you must keep records of all payments made toward the debt, including any interest paid.\\n### Nonbusiness Bad Debts\\nNonbusiness bad debts are those that come from personal loans or credit card purchases. These types of debts are generally considered short-term capital losses and are deducted as such on Form 1040.\\nHowever, if you use a portion of your home equity to pay off a nonbusiness bad debt, you may be able to deduct the interest paid on the loan as mortgage interest. To qualify for this deduction, you must meet certain requirements, such as using the funds for qualified home improvements and keeping detailed records of the transaction.\\nFor more information on deducting nonbusiness bad debts, see Pub. 550.\"],\n",

Goods that have been sold, but not yet paid for, and services that have been performed, but not yet paid for, are recorded in your books as either accounts receivable or notes receivable. After a reasonable period of time, if you have tried to collect the amount due, but are unable to do so, the uncollectible part of the receivables becomes a business bad debt.\\nAccounts or notes receivable valued at fair market value (F/M) when received are deductible only at that value, even though the F/M may be less than the face value. If you purchased an account receivable for less than its face value, and the receivable subsequently becomes worthless, the most youre allowed to deduct is the amount you paid to acquire it.\\nYou can claim a business bad debt deduction only if the amount owed to you varies was previously included in gross income. This applies to amounts owned to you from all sources of taxable income, including sales, services, rents, and interest.\\nquestion: Question 1: What are business bad debts?; Question 2: How are accounts or notes receivable valued when received?; Question 3: When can a business bad debt deduction be claimed?\"],\n",

You can only claim a bad debt deduction for an uncollectible receivable if you have previously included the uncollectible amount in income.\\nIf you qualify, you can use the nonactual-experience method of accounting, discussed later. Under this method, you don't have to accrue income that, based on your experience, you don't expect to collect. Instead, you report income when it is actually collected. This method allows you to take advantage of any unexpected increase in revenue during the year. However, you must be able to demonstrate that you are not using the nonactual-experience method to avoid paying taxes or to hide losses.\\nquestion: Question 1: When should I use an accxual method of accounting?; Question 2: How do I determine whether I am eligible to use the nonactual-experience method of accounting?; Question 3: What happens if I use the nonactual-experience method of accounting and my actual revenue turns out to be less than expected?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Use an accxual method of accounting when you want to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); Answer 2: To be eligible to use the nonactual-experience method of accounting, you need to meet certain criteria such as having a history of collecting at least 70% of your accounts receivable within one year from their due date; Answer 3: If your actual revenue turns out to be less than expected, you may still be required to pay taxes on the reported revenue under the nonactual-experience method of accounting.\"],\n",

You can't claim a bad debt deduction for amounts owed to you because you never included those amounts in income. For example, a cash basis architected can't claim a bad debt deduction if a client fails to pay the bill because the architect's fee was never included in income.\\nquestion: Question 1: When do you report income using the cash method of accounting?; Question 2: Can you claim a bad debt deduction under the cash method of accounting?; Question 3: If you use the cash method of accounting, what is your responsibility regarding unpaid bills?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: You report income when you receive payment; Answer 2: No, you cannot claim a bad debt deduction under the cash method of accounting; Answer 3: Your responsibility regarding unpaid bills is not to claim a bad debt deduction since it was never included in income.\"],\n",

Business bad debts are not considered tax-deductible expenses because they are not considered ordinary losses. Instead, they are treated as nonbusiness property losses. Nonbusiness property losses can be deducted from your personal income up to $500 per year. If you have more than one nonbusiness property loss, you can combine them into one deduction. However, if you have a nonbusiness property loss that exceeds $500, it is not tax-deductible.\\nquestion: Question 1: What type of loans are included in business bad debts?; Question 2: How are business bad debts treated for tax purposes?; Question 3: What is the maximum amount that can be deducted from personal income due to nonbusiness property losses?;\\nanswer: Answer 1: Clients, suppliers, employees, and distributors; Answer 2: Not considered ordinary losses but treated as nonbusiness property losses; Answer 3: Up to $500 per year.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## When a Debt Becomes Worthless\\nA debt becomes worthless when there is no longer any chance the amount owed will be paid. This may occur on the date the debt is due or prior to that date.\\nTo demonstrate worthlessness, you must only show that you have taken reasonable steps to collect the debt but were unable to do so. It isn\\'t necessary to go to court if you can show that a judgment from the court would be uncollectible. Bankruptcy of your debtor is generally good evidence of the worthlessness of at least a part of an unsecured and unpreferred debt.\\n**Property received for debt.** If you receive property in partial settlement of a debt, reduce the debt by the property\\'s fMV, which becomes the property\\'s basis. You can deduct the remaining debt as a bad debt if and when it becomes worthless.\\nIf you later sell the property for more than its basis, any gain on the sale is due to the appreciation of the property. It isn\\'t a recovery of a bad debt. For information on the sale of an asset, see Pub. 544.\\n**Sale of property for less than its basis.** If you sell the property for less than its basis, you recognize a loss on the sale. However, if you are able to recover some portion of the loss through insurance or other means, you can treat the recovered portion as income.\\n**Deduction of bad debts.** Bad debts are not taxable unless they become worthless. If a bad debt becomes worthless, you can deduct the amount of the bad debt as a business expense.\\n**Bad debt write-off.** If a bad debt becomes worthless before the end of the year, you can claim a bad debt write-off on your return for that year. If a bad debt becomes worthless after the end of the year, you can claim a bad debt write-off on your next return.\\n**Bad debt carryforward.** If a bad debt becomes worthless before the end of the year, you can carry forward the bad debt write-off to future years until used up. If a bad debt becomes worthless after the end of the year, you can carry forward the bad debt write-off to future years until used up.\\n**Bad debt carryback.** If a bad debt becomes worthless before the end of the year, you can carry back the bad debt write-off to previous years until used up. If a bad debt becomes worthless after the end of the year, you can carry back the bad debt write-off to previous years until used up.\\n**Bad debt treatment.** Bad debts are treated as nonrecoverable expenses. They are not included in gross income.\\n**Bad debt accounting.** Bad debts are accounted for using the accrual method. Any interest earned on a bad debt is recognized immediately as income. Any bad debt losses are recognized immediately as expenses.\\n**Bad debt reporting.** Bad debts are reported on financial statements under the provision \"bad debts.\"\\n**Bad debt collection.** Bad debts should be collected as soon as possible. If a bad debt cannot be collected, it should be written off as worthless.\\n**Bad debt payment plan.** A payment plan for bad debts should be considered if the debtor has sufficient assets to pay off the debt over time.\\n**Bad debt restructuring.** Bad debts can be restructured into new loans with lower interest rates or extended repayment periods.\\n**Bad debt consolidation.** Bad debts can be consolidated into one loan with a lower interest rate or extended repayment period.\\n**Bad debt refinancing.** Bad debts can be refinanced with a lower interest rate or extended repayment period.\\n**Bad debt workout.** A bad debt workout involves negotiating a reduced payment plan or settlement with the creditor.\\n**Bad debt bankruptcy.** A bad debt bankruptcy occurs when a debtor files for bankruptcy because of their bad debts.'],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## How To Claim a Business Bad Debt\\nThere are two methods to claim a business bad debt.\\n* The specific charge-off method.\\n* The nonaccrual-experience method.\\nGenerally, you must use the specific charge-off method. However, you may use the nonaccrual-experience method if you meet the requirements discussed later under _Monaccrual-Exvenience Method_.\\nThe specific charge-off method involves charging off the bad debt as an expense on your income tax return. This is done when you have exhausted all collection efforts and there is no reasonable expectation that you will collect payment from the customer. You can also use this method if you have sold or transferred ownership of the business assets used to generate the bad debt.\\nThe nonaccrual-experience method allows you to deduct the bad debt amount immediately instead of spreading it over several years. This method requires that you have not received any payments on the bad debt during the current year and that you expect to receive no payments in the future. Additionally, you must be able to demonstrate that the bad debt has been charged off and that you have made good faith efforts to collect payment.\\nIt is important to note that both methods require documentation to support your claim. For example, you should keep records of all collection efforts and any correspondence with the customer regarding the bad debt.\\nIn summary, the specific charge-off method is generally preferred but the nonaccrual-experience method can be used if certain conditions are met. Both methods require documentation to support the claim.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Specific Charge-off Method\\nIf you use the specific charge-off method, you can deduct specific business bad debts that become partly or totally worthless during the tax year. However, with respect to partly worthless bad debts, your deduction is limited to the amount you charged off on your books during the year.\\n**Partly worthless debts.** You can deduct specific bad debts that become partly undecollective during the tax year. Your tax deduction is limited to the amount you charge off on your books during the year. You don\\'t have to charge off and deduct your partly worthless debts annually. You can delay the charge-off until a later year. However, you can\\'t deduct any part of a debt after the year it becomes totally worthless.\\n_Significantly modified debt._ An exception to the charge-off rule exists for debt that has been significantly modified and on which the holder recognized gain. For more information, see Regulations section 1.166-3(a)(3).\\n_Deduction disallowed._ Generally, you can claim a partial bad debt deduction only in the year you make the charge-off on your books. If, under audit, the IRS doesn\\'t allow your deduction and the debt becomes partly worthless in a later tax year, you can deduct the amount you charged off in that year plus the disallowed amount charged off in the earlier year. The charge-off in the earlier year, unless reversed on your books, fulfills the charge-off requirement for the later year.\\n**Totally worthless debts.** If a debt becomes totally worthless in the current tax year, you can deduct the entire amount minus any amount deducted in an earlier tax year when the debt was only partly worthless.\\nYou don\\'t have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don\\'t and the IRS later are about deduct that did not reduce your tax. Report the _recovery_ as \"Other income\" on the appropriate business form or schedule.\\n_See Recoveries_ in Pub. 525 for more information.\\n_NOL carryover._ If a bad debt deduction increases an NOL carryover that has not expired before the beginning of the tax year in which the recovery takes place, you treat the deduction as having reduced your tax. A bad debt deduction that contributes to an NOL helps lower taxes in the year to which you carry the NOL. For more information about NOLs for individuals, see Pub. 536. Also, see the instructions for Form 1045, and the instructions for Form 1139.\\n_Tax treatment of recoveries_. When you receive a payment from a previously written off debt, report it as other income on the appropriate business form or schedule. If you didn\\'t write off the debt and received a payment, report it as other income on the appropriate personal form or schedule.\\n_Bad debt deduction rules_. See Publication 525, Tax Rules for Business and Self-Employed Persons, for detailed information about bad debt deductions.'],\n",

Businesses that deal with virtual currencies must keep accurate records of their transactions and report any gains or losses on Form 1099-K. Individuals who receive virtual currency as payment for goods or services must report it as income on their tax return.\\n**Electronic filing deadline.** The deadline for electronic filing of individual federal income tax returns is April 18, 2022. If you cannot file electronically, you can still file a paper return by mail by the same date.\\n### What's Old\\n**Child Tax Credit (CTC).** The CTC provides up to $2,000 per qualifying child under age 17. Eligible parents may also be able to claim an additional credit of up to $500 per dependent child over age 17. To qualify for the CTC, you must have earned income from employment, self-employment, or certain government benefits. You must also meet certain other requirements, such as having a Social Security number and being a U.S. citizen or resident alien.\\n**Retirement plans.** Employers may offer retirement plans, such as defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, or individual retirement accounts (IRAs). These plans allow employees to save money for retirement and often provide matching contributions from employers. Contributions to these plans are generally made pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Withdrawals from these plans are subject to taxes and penalties if taken before age 59 ½.\\n**Health savings accounts (HSAs).** HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts that allow individuals to save money for medical expenses on a tax-free basis. Contributions to HSAs are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-deferred until withdrawn for qualified medical expenses. Unused funds in an HSA can roll over from one year to the next and earnings on investments within the account are tax-free.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Reminders\\n**No miscellaneous itemized deductions allowed.** You can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions, including the deduction for repayments (claim of right). Miscellaneous itemized deductions are those deductions that would have been subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limitation.\\n**Qualified business income deduction.** For tax years beginning after 2017, individual tax papers and some trusts and estates may be entitled to a deduction of up to 20% of their qualified business income (QBI) from a trade or business, including income from a pass-through entity, but not from a C Corporation, plus 20% of qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income. The deduction is subject to multiple limitations, such as the type of trade or business, the taxpayer's taxable income, the amount of W-2 wages paid in the trade or business, and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property held by the trade or business. The deduction can be taken in addition to the standard or itemized deductions. See the instructions for Form 8995 and the instructions for Form 8995-A for more information.\\n**Chapter 11**: **Other Expenses**\\nPage 43Travel, meals, and entertainment. In general, entertainment expenses are no longer deductible. For more information on travel and non-entertainment-related meals, including deductibility, see Pub. 463.\\nCertain payments made in sexual harassment or sexual abuse cases. For amounts paid or incurred after December 22, 2017, new section 162(q) provides that no deduction is allowed under section 162 for any settlement or payment related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse if it is subject to a nondiscoluse agreement. In addition, attorney's fees related to such a settlement or payment aren't allowed as a deduction. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, if an employee receives a payment or settlement before entering into a nondisclosure agreement, the payment or settlement isn’t subject to the nondisclosure requirement. Similarly, if an employer pays an employee who has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the payment or settlement isn’t subject to the nondisclosure requirement.\\n**Chapter 12**: **Taxes**\\nPage 44Income taxes paid to foreign governments. If you pay income taxes to a foreign government, you may be able to take a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability for those taxes. To do so, you must file Form 1040-NR, which is used to report foreign income and foreign income taxes paid. Filing Form 1040-NR doesn’t affect whether you owe additional U.S. federal income tax. It only reduces the amount of U.S. federal income tax you owe.\\nIf you don’t need to file Form 1040-NR because you didn’t pay foreign income taxes, you still need to keep records of all foreign income and foreign income taxes paid. These records may be needed later if you decide to claim a credit for foreign income taxes paid.\\n**Chapter 13**: **Estate Taxes**\\nPage 45The basic exclusion amount. The basic exclusion amount is $11,180,000 for tax year 2021. This means that each person can leave up to $11,180,000 of assets without owing estate tax. Any amount above the basic exclusion amount is taxed at a rate of 40%.\\nGifts to individuals. Gifts to individuals are generally not included in the calculation of the estate tax. However, gifts over certain limits are subject to gift tax. For tax year 2021, the annual exclusion amount is $15,000 per donee. Gifts over $15,000 are taxed at a rate of 15%, with a maximum tax rate of 37% on gifts over $5 million.\\n**Chapter 14**: **Retirement Plans**\\nPage 46Contributions to traditional IRA accounts. Contributions to traditional IRA accounts are generally tax-deductible. However, contributions to traditional IRA accounts are limited by law. For tax year 2021, the contribution limit is $6,000 per person. Contributions to traditional IRA accounts made by age 70½ are also required to be withdrawn annually. Withdrawals from traditional IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income when they are distributed.\\nRoth IRA contributions. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning that you have already paid income tax on the money you contribute. However, qualified withdrawals from Roth IRA accounts are tax-free. Qualified withdrawals are defined as distributions made at least five years after the first contribution and at least one year after age 59½. Nonqualified withdrawals from Roth IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income.\\n**Chapter 15**: **Health Insurance Coverage**\\nPage 47Individual health insurance premiums. Individual health insurance premiums are generally not tax-deductible unless you meet certain requirements. To be eligible for a tax deduction, you must purchase health insurance through an exchange established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or through a state\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### Reimbursers\\nA \"reimbursement or allowance arrangement\" provides for payment of advances, reimbursments, and allowances for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses incurred by your employees during the ordinary course of business. If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records. For example, you can deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. However, only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction.\\nHow you deduct a business expense under a reimbursement or allowance arrangement depends on whether you have:\\n* An accountable plan, or\\n* A nonaccountable plan.\\nIf you reimburse these expenses under an accountable plan, deduct them as travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses.\\nIf you reimburse these expenses under a nonaccountable plan, report the reimbursments as wages on Form W-2, and deduct them as wages on the appropriate line of your tax return. If you make a single payment to your employees and it includes both wages and an expense reimbursement, you must specify the amount of the reimbursement and report it accordingly. See Table 11-1.\\nquestion: Question 1: How does one deduct a business expense under a reimbursement or allowance arrangement? ; Question 2: What is the difference between an accountable plan and a nonaccountable plan? ; Question 3: Can one deduct 100% of the cost of meals on their business books and records?\\nanswer: Answer 1: Deducting a business expense under a reimbursement or allowance arrangement depends on whether you have an accountable plan or a nonaccountable plan. Under an accountable plan, deduct the expenses as travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. Under a nonaccountable plan, report the reimbursals as wages on Form W-2 and deduct them as wages on the appropriate line of your tax return. If you make a single payment that includes both wages and an expense reimbursement, specify the amount of the reimbursement and report it accordingly. See Table 11-1.\\nAnswer 2: An accountable plan requires employees to submit detailed receipts for all expenses they want to be reimbursed. These receipts must be submitted within a reasonable period after the expenses were paid. Nonaccountable plans do not require receipts and assume that all expenses are necessary and reasonable.\\nAnswer 3: No, you cannot deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. Only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction.'],\n",

Generally, actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time.\\n1. You give an advance within 30 days of the time the employee pays or incurs the expense.\\n2. Your employees adequately account for their expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred.\\n3. Your employees return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred.\\n4. You give a periodic statement (at least quarterly) to your employees that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances _and_ they comply within 120 days of the date of the statement.\\nHow to deduct You can claim a deduction for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses if you reinfunwise your employees for these expenses under an accountable plan. Generally, the amount you can deduct for non-entertainment-related meals subject to a 50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole proprieter, or are filing as a single member limited liability company, deduct the travel reimbursement on line 24a and the deductible part of the non-entertainment-related meals reimbursement on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040).\\nIf you are filing an income tax return for a corporation, include the reimbursement on the _Other deductions_ line of Form 1120. If you are filling any other business income tax return, such as a partnership or S corporation return, deduct the reimbursement on the appropriate line of the return as provided in the instructions for that return.\\nWhat is an accountable plan? An accountable plan is a written agreement between you and your employees that requires them to report all expenses related to their job duties and to provide receipts for those expenses. Under this plan, you agree to pay your employees for certain types of expenses, such as travel and meal expenses, upfront. However, you also require your employees to repay you for any expenses that are not properly documented or that exceed the amounts allowed under the plan. This allows you to keep track of your expenses and ensures that you do not have to pay out more money than you owe.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ## Per Diem and Car Allowances\\nYou can reimburse your employees under an accountable plan based on travel days, miles, or some other fixed allowance. In these cases, your employee is considered to have accounted to you for the amount of the expense that doesn't exceed the rates established by the federal government. Your employee must actually substantiate to you the other elements of the expense, such as time, place, and business purpose.\\nFederal rate The federal rate can be figured using any one of the following methods.\\n1. For car expenses: 1. The standard mileage rate. 2. A fixed and variable rate (FAVR).\\n2. For per diem amounts: 1. The regular federal per diem rate. 2. The standard meal allowance. 3. The high-low rate.\\nCar allowance Your employee is considered to have accounted to you for car expenses that don't exceed the standard mileage rate. For tax year 2022, the standard business mileage rate is:\\n* 58.5 cents per mile for January 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022; and\\n* 62.5 cents per mile for July 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022.\\nTo find the standard mileage rate for 2023, go to _IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mieage-Bates_.\\nYou can choose to reimburse your employees using an FAVR allowance. This is an allowance that includes a combination of payments covering fixed and variable costs, such as a cents-per-mile rate to cover your employees' variable operating costs (such as gas, oil, etc.) plus a flat amount to cover your employees' fixed costs (such as depreciation, insurance, etc.). For information on using an FAVR allowance, see Revenue Procedure 2019-46, available at _IRS.gov/itb2019-49_ /_IRB.gov/itb/2022-02_ /_IRB_.\\nPer diem allowance If your employee actually substantiates to you the other elements (discussed earlier) of the expenses reimbursed using the per diem allowance, how you report and deduct the allowance depends on whether the allowance is for lodging and meal expenses or for meal expenses only and whether the allowance is more than the federal rate.\\nRegular federal per diem rate The regular federal per diem rate is the highest amount the federal government will pay to its employees while away from home on travel. It has the following two components.\\n1. Lodging expense.\\n2. Meal and incidental expenses (M&IE).\\nThe rates are different for different locations. See _GSA.gov/erdiem_ for the per diem rates in the continental United States.\\nStandard meal allowance The federal rate for M&IE is the standard meal allowance. You can pay only on M&IE allowance to employees who travel away from home it:\\n* You pay the employee for actual expenses per diem and car allowances. The manner in which you report them depends on how the allowance compares to the federal rate. See _Tax_: lodging 11-1.\\nAllowance less than or equal to the federal rate If you allowance for the employee is less than or equal to the appropriate federal rate, that allowance isn't included as part of the employee's pay in box 1 of the employee's Form W-2. Deduct the allowance as travel expenses (including meals that may be subject to the 50% limit, discussed later). See _How to deduct under Accountable Plans_, earlier.\\n_Allowance more than the federal rate._ If your employee's allowance is more than the appropriate federal rate, you must report the allowance as two separate items.\\nInclude the allowance amount up to the federal rate in box 12 (code L) of the employee's Form W-2. Deduct it as travel expenses (explained above). This part of the allowance is treated as reimbursed under an accountable plan.\\nInclude the amount that is more than the federal rate in box 1 (and in boxes 3 and 5 if they apply) of the employees' Form W-2. Deduct it as ways subject to income tax withholding, social security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes. This part of the allowance is treated as reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan (explained later) under Nonaccountable Plans.\"],\n",

Shannon; Answer 2: The concept of information entropy; Answer 3: The theory of information;\\ncontext: ### How Can You Learn About Your Taxpayer Rights?\\nThe Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. Go to _Taxpayer.ak/.pick/.pick_ to help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are _your_ rights. Know them. Use them.\\nYou can find a list of your rights and the IRS\\'s obligations to protect them in _Pub.L.Y. Your Rights as a Taxayer_. It includes the following.\\n1. **The Right To Be Informed.** Taxayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.\\n2. **The Right to Quality Service.** Taxayers have the right to receive prompt, courous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service.\\n3. **The Right To Pay No More Than the Correct Amount of Tax.** Taxayers have the right to expect the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.\\n4. **The Right To Challenge the IRS\\'s Position and Be Head.** Taxayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.\\n5. **The Right To Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum.** Taxayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals\\' decision. Taxayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.\\n6. **The Right to Finality.** Taxayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS\\'s position as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit.\\n7. **The Right to Privacy.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protections, and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing.\\n8. **The Right to Confidentiality.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxayer or by law. Taxayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return prepares, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.\\n9. **The Right To Retain Representation.** Taxayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation.\\n10. **The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System.** Taxayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. Taxayers have the right to receive assistance from TAS if they are experiencing financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and timely through its normal channels.\\nThe IRS is working to increase the number of Americans who know and understand their rights under the tax law. To expand awareness, the IRS makes _Pub.l_ available in multiple languages on IRS.gov. This important publication is available in the following languages.\\n* **English, Your Rights as a Taxayer, at (IS.gov/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lTo help us develop a more useful index, please let us know if you have ideas for index entries.

Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records.

If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records. For example, you can deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. However, only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction.   \n",

Your employees must adequately account to you for their travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. They must give you documentary evidence of their travel, mileage, and other employee business expenses. This evidence should include items such as receipts, along with either a statement of expenses, an account book, a day planner, or similar record in which the employee entered each expense at or near the time the expense was incurred.   \n",

Answer 1: Deducting a business expense under a reimbursement or allowance arrangement depends on whether you have an accountable plan or a nonaccountable plan. Under an accountable plan, deduct the expenses as travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. Under a nonaccountable plan, report the reimbursals as wages on Form W-2 and deduct them as wages on the appropriate line of your tax return. If you make a single payment that includes both wages and an expense reimbursement, specify the amount of the reimbursement and report it accordingly. See Table 11-1.  \n",

The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The IRS has issued guidance on how to report virtual currency transactions.** Virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, are digital assets used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. The IRS has issued guidance on how to report virtual currency transactions, including virtual currency purchases, sales, exchanges, and transfers. Reporting requirements apply to all U.S. persons who engage in virtual currency transactions, regardless of whether they are residents of the United States or foreign nationals.

Capital expenses are considered assets in your business. In general, you capitalize three types of costs. * Business startup costs (see _Tip_ below). * Business assets. * Improvements. You can elect to deduct or amortize certain business startup costs. See chapters 7 and 8. ## Tip Business startup costs include any costs that help you get your business off the ground. Examples include rent, utilities, salaries, supplies, equipment, and legal fees. You may be able to deduct these costs if they are necessary for starting your business. However, if you choose to deduct them instead of capitalizing them, you cannot later claim depreciation on those items.

Generally, actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time. 1. You give an advance within 30 days of the time the employee pays or incurs the expense. 2. Your employees adequately account for their expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 3. Your employees return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 4. You give a periodic statement (at least quarterly) to your employees that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances _and_ they comply within 120 days of the date of the statement. How to deduct You can claim a deduction for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses if you reinfunwise your employees for these expenses under an accountable plan. Generally, the amount you can deduct for non-entertainment-related meals subject to a 50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole proprieter, or are filing as a single member limited liability company, deduct the travel reimbursement on line 24a and the deductible part of the non-entertainment-related meals reimbursement on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040). If you are filing an income tax return for a corporation, include the reimbursement on the _Other deductions_ line of Form 1120. If you are filling any other business income tax return, such as a partnership or S corporation return, deduct the reimbursement on the appropriate line of the return as provided in the instructions for that return. To qualify for this deduction, you must have an accountable plan in place. An accountable plan is a written policy that requires employees to submit receipts for all meal expenses and to report the expenses to you. It also specifies how long the employee has to file the receipt and report the expense. Under an accountable plan, you do not need to pay taxes on the reimbursed amounts. However, you may still be required to keep records of the payments made to employees. What is the purpose of section 7202(c)? The purpose of Section 7202(c) is to provide a mechanism for employers to recover overpayments made to employees under an accountable plan. Employers who make overpayments to employees under an accountable plan can require the employees to repay the overpayments. This provision applies only to overpayments made under an accountable plan. Overpayments made under a nontaxable fringe benefit plan are not subject to recovery under Section 7202(c).</td>\n",

Your employee must actually substantiate to you the other elements of the expense, such as time, place, and business purpose.

Go to _Taxpayer.ak/.pick/.pick_ to help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are _your_ rights. Know them. Use them. You can find a list of your rights and the IRS's obligations to protect them in _Pub.L.Y. Your Rights as a Taxayer_. It includes the following. 1. **The Right To Be Informed.** Taxayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes. 2. **The Right to Quality Service.** Taxayers have the right to receive prompt, courous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service. 3. **The Right To Pay No More Than the Correct Amount of Tax.** Taxayers have the right to expect the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. 4. **The Right To Challenge the IRS's Position and Be Head.** Taxayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position. 5. **The Right To Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum.** Taxayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals' decision. Taxayers generally have the right to take their cases to court. 6. **The Right to Finality.** Taxayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS's position as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit. 7. **The Right to Privacy.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protections, and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing. 8. **The Right to Confidentiality.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxayer or by law. Taxayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return prepares, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information. 9. **The Right To Retain Representation.** Taxayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation. 10. **The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System.** Taxayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. Taxayers have the right to receive assistance from TAS if they are experiencing financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and timely through its normal channels. The IRS is working to increase the number of Americans who know and understand their rights under the tax law. To expand awareness, the IRS makes _Pub.l_ available in multiple languages on IRS.gov.

What's New for 2022 The following items highlight some changes in the tax law for 2022. **Form 1098-k reporting transition period.** The transition period described in _Notice 2023-10_ delays the reporting of transactions in excess of 5600 to transactions that occur after calendar year 2022. The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The IRS has issued guidance on how to report virtual currency transactions.** Virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, are digital assets used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. The IRS has issued guidance on how to report virtual currency transactions, including virtual currency purchases, sales, exchanges, and transfers. Reporting requirements apply to all U.S. persons who engage in virtual currency transactions, regardless of whether they are residents of the United States or foreign nationals.

These costs are a part of your investment in your business and are called 'capital expenses.' Capital expenses are considered assets in your business. In general, you capitalize three types of costs. * Business startup costs (see _Tip_ below). * Business assets. * Improvements. You can elect to deduct or amortize certain business startup costs. See chapters 7 and 8. ## Tip Business startup costs include any costs that help you get your business off the ground. Examples include rent, utilities, salaries, supplies, equipment, and legal fees. You may be able to deduct these costs if they are necessary for starting your business. However, if you choose to deduct them instead of capitalizing them, you cannot later claim depreciation on those items. If you decide to capitalize these costs, you can write them off over time using bonus depreciation or Section 167(f)(3) property tax treatment.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ### Reasonable period of time. A reasonable period of time depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time. 1. You give an advance within 30 days of the time the employee pays or incurs the expense. 2. Your employees adequately account for their expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 3. Your employees return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 4. You give a periodic statement (at least quarterly) to your employees that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances _and_ they comply within 120 days of the date of the statement. How to deduct You can claim a deduction for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses if you reinfunwise your employees for these expenses under an accountable plan. Generally, the amount you can deduct for non-entertainment-related meals subject to a 50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole proprieter, or are filing as a single member limited liability company, deduct the travel reimbursement on line 24a and the deductible part of the non-entertainment-related meals reimbursement on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040). If you are filing an income tax return for a corporation, include the reimbursement on the _Other deductions_ line of Form 1120. If you are filling any other business income tax return, such as a partnership or S corporation return, deduct the reimbursement on the appropriate line of the return as provided in the instructions for that return. To qualify for this deduction, you must have an accountable plan in place. An accountable plan is a written policy that requires employees to submit receipts for all meal expenses and to report the expenses to you. It also specifies how long the employee has to file the receipt and report the expense. Under an accountable plan, you do not need to pay taxes on the reimbursed amounts. However, you may still be required to keep records of the payments made to employees. What is the purpose of section 7202(c)? The purpose of Section 7202(c) is to provide a mechanism for employers to recover overpayments made to employees under an accountable plan. Employers who make overpayments to employees under an accountable plan can require the employees to repay the overpayments. This provision applies only to overpayments made under an accountable plan. Overpayments made under a nontaxable fringe benefit plan are not subject to recovery under Section 7202(c).   \n",

TAS is an _Independent_ organization within the IRS that helps taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. Their job is to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights under the _Taxpayer Bill of Rights_. They also help resolve disputes between taxpayers and the IRS.   \n",
       "194  ### How Can You Learn About Your Taxpayer Rights? The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. Go to _Taxpayer.ak/.pick/.pick_ to help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are _your_ rights. Know them. Use them. You can find a list of your rights and the IRS's obligations to protect them in _Pub.L.Y. Your Rights as a Taxayer_. It includes the following. 1. **The Right To Be Informed.** Taxayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes. 2. **The Right to Quality Service.** Taxayers have the right to receive prompt, courous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service. 3. **The Right To Pay No More Than the Correct Amount of Tax.** Taxayers have the right to expect the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. 4. **The Right To Challenge the IRS's Position and Be Head.** Taxayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position. 5. **The Right To Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum.** Taxayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals' decision. Taxayers generally have the right to take their cases to court. 6. **The Right to Finality.** Taxayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS's position as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit. 7. **The Right to Privacy.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protections, and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing. 8. **The Right to Confidentiality.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxayer or by law. Taxayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return prepares, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information. 9. **The Right To Retain Representation.** Taxayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation. 10. **The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System.** Taxayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. Taxayers have the right to receive assistance from TAS if they are experiencing financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and timely through its normal channels. The IRS is working to increase the number of Americans who know and understand their rights under the tax law. To expand awareness, the IRS makes _Pub.l_ available in multiple languages on IRS.gov. This important publication is available in the following languages. * **English, Your Rights as a Taxayer, at (IS.gov/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lTo help us develop a more useful index, please let us know if you have ideas for index entries.

If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records.

Under a nonaccountable plan, report the reimbursals as wages on Form W-2 and deduct them as wages on the appropriate line of your tax return. If you make a single payment that includes both wages and an expense reimbursement, specify the amount of the reimbursement and report it accordingly. See Table 11-1.</td>\n",

These recovery methods allow you to deduct part of your cost each year. In this way, you are able to recover your capital expense. See _Amortization_ (chapter 8) and _Dealization_ (chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can elect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction. A greater portion of these costs can be deducted if the property is qualified disaster assistance property. See Pub. 946 for details.   \n",
