The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The CARES Act provided for a temporary increase in the contribution limit for traditional IRA contributions made by employees who were not covered by a retirement plan at work during 2020.** Under section 72(t)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the CARES Act, the maximum amount that may be contributed to a traditional IRA for the 2020 tax year was increased from $6,000 to $7,000 for individuals who did not participate in a workplace retirement plan during 2020. This provision applies only to contributions made to traditional IRAs, not to Roth IRAs. Contributions to traditional IRAs are generally deductible on an individual’s federal income tax return, while contributions to Roth IRAs are made with aftertax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.</td>\n",

Generally, actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time. 1. You give an advance within 30 days of the time the employee pays or incurs the expense. 2. Your employees adequately account for their expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 3. Your employees return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 4. You give a periodic statement (at least quarterly) to your employees that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances _and_ they comply within 120 days of the date of the statement. How to deduct You can claim a deduction for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses if you reinfunwise your employees for these expenses under an accountable plan. Generally, the amount you can deduct for non-entertainment-related meals subject to a 50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole proprieter, or are filing as a single member limited liability company, deduct the travel reimbursement on line 24a and the deductible part of the non-entertainment-related meals reimbursement on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040). If you are filing an income tax return for a corporation, include the reimbursement on the _Other deductions_ line of Form 1120. If you are filling any other business income tax return, such as a partnership or S corporation return, deduct the reimbursement on the appropriate line of the return as provided in the instructions for that return. To qualify for this deduction, you must have an accountable plan in place. An accountable plan is a written policy that requires employees to submit receipts for all meal expenses and to report the expenses to you. The policy must also require employees to repay any amounts not substantiated by receipts. What is an accountable plan?

Go to _Taxpayer.ak/.pick/.pick_ to help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are _your_ rights. Know them. Use them. You can find a list of your rights and the IRS's obligations to protect them in _Pub.L.Y. Your Rights as a Taxayer_. It includes the following. 1. **The Right To Be Informed.** Taxayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes. 2. **The Right to Quality Service.** Taxayers have the right to receive prompt, courous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service. 3. **The Right To Pay No More Than the Correct Amount of Tax.** Taxayers have the right to expect the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. 4. **The Right To Challenge the IRS's Position and Be Head.** Taxayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position. 5. **The Right To Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum.** Taxayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals' decision. Taxayers generally have the right to take their cases to court. 6. **The Right to Finality.** Taxayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS's position as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit. 7. **The Right to Privacy.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protections, and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing. 8. **The Right to Confidentiality.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxayer or by law. Taxayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return prepares, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information. 9. **The Right To Retain Representation.** Taxayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation. 10. **The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System.** Taxayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely.

The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The CARES Act provided for a temporary increase in the contribution limit for traditional IRA contributions made by employees who were not covered by a retirement plan at work during 2020.** Under section 72(t)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the CARES Act, the maximum amount that may be contributed to a traditional IRA for the 2020 tax year was increased from $6,000 to $7,000 for individuals who did not participate in a workplace retirement plan during 2020. This provision applies only to contributions made to traditional IRAs, not to Roth IRAs. Contributions to traditional IRAs are generally deductible on an individual’s federal income tax return, while contributions to Roth IRAs are made with aftertax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.   \n",

You must capitalize, rather than deduct, some costs. These costs are a part of your investment in your business and are called 'capital expenses.' Capital expenses are considered assets in your business. In general, you capitalize three types of costs. * Business startup costs (see _Tip_ below). * Business assets. * Improvements. You can elect to deduct or amortize certain business startup costs.

  ### Reasonable period of time. A reasonable period of time depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time. 1. You give an advance within 30 days of the time the employee pays or incurs the expense. 2. Your employees adequately account for their expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 3. Your employees return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. 4. You give a periodic statement (at least quarterly) to your employees that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances _and_ they comply within 120 days of the date of the statement. How to deduct You can claim a deduction for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses if you reinfunwise your employees for these expenses under an accountable plan. Generally, the amount you can deduct for non-entertainment-related meals subject to a 50% limit, discussed later. If you are a sole proprieter, or are filing as a single member limited liability company, deduct the travel reimbursement on line 24a and the deductible part of the non-entertainment-related meals reimbursement on line 24b of Schedule C (Form 1040). If you are filing an income tax return for a corporation, include the reimbursement on the _Other deductions_ line of Form 1120. If you are filling any other business income tax return, such as a partnership or S corporation return, deduct the reimbursement on the appropriate line of the return as provided in the instructions for that return. To qualify for this deduction, you must have an accountable plan in place. An accountable plan is a written policy that requires employees to submit receipts for all meal expenses and to report the expenses to you. The policy must also require employees to repay any amounts not substantiated by receipts. What is an accountable plan?

                                      ### What Is TAS? TAS is an _Independent_ organization within the IRS that helps taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. Their job is to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights under the _Taxpayer Bill of Rights_. They also help with issues related to taxes, such as how to file taxes, what forms to use, and how to pay taxes on time.   \n",
       "195  ### How Can You Learn About Your Taxpayer Rights? The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. Go to _Taxpayer.ak/.pick/.pick_ to help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are _your_ rights. Know them. Use them. You can find a list of your rights and the IRS's obligations to protect them in _Pub.L.Y. Your Rights as a Taxayer_. It includes the following. 1. **The Right To Be Informed.** Taxayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes. 2. **The Right to Quality Service.** Taxayers have the right to receive prompt, courous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service. 3. **The Right To Pay No More Than the Correct Amount of Tax.** Taxayers have the right to expect the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. 4. **The Right To Challenge the IRS's Position and Be Head.** Taxayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position. 5. **The Right To Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum.** Taxayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals' decision. Taxayers generally have the right to take their cases to court. 6. **The Right to Finality.** Taxayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS's position as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit. 7. **The Right to Privacy.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protections, and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing. 8. **The Right to Confidentiality.** Taxayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxayer or by law. Taxayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return prepares, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information. 9. **The Right To Retain Representation.** Taxayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation. 10. **The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System.** Taxayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. Taxayers have the right to receive assistance from TAS if they are experiencing financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and timely through its normal channels. The IRS is working to increase the number of Americans who know and understand their rights under the tax law. To expand awareness, the IRS makes _Pub.l_ available in multiple languages on IRS.gov. This important publication is available in the following languages. * **English, Your Rights as a Taxayer, at (IS.gov/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.lPub.l/Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lPub.Pub.lPub.lPub.Pub.lTo help us develop a more useful index, please let us know if you have ideas for index entries.

The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The CARES Act provided for a temporary increase in the contribution limit for traditional IRA contributions made by employees who were not covered by a retirement plan at work during 2020.** Under section 72(t)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the CARES Act, the maximum amount that may be contributed to a traditional IRA for the 2020 tax year was increased from $6,000 to $7,000 for individuals who did not participate in a workplace retirement plan during 2020. This provision applies only to contributions made to traditional IRAs, not to Roth IRAs. Contributions to traditional IRAs are generally deductible on an individual’s federal income tax return, while contributions to Roth IRAs are made with aftertax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.</td>\n",

       "2    ## What's New for 2022 The following items highlight some changes in the tax law for 2022. **Form 1098-k reporting transition period.** The transition period described in _Notice 2023-10_ delays the reporting of transactions in excess of 5600 to transactions that occur after calendar year 2022. The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payge compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payge, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction. **The COVID-19 related credit for qualified sick and family leave wages is limited to leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021.** Generally, the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, as enacted under the _Families_ First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and extended by the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified sick and family leave wages in 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The COVID-19 related employee retention credit has expired.** The employee retention credit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and amended and extended by the Taxplayer certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 was limited to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. The employee retention credit under section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the ARP and amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was limited to wages paid after June 30, 2021, and before October 1, 2021, unless the employer was a recovery startup business. An employer that was a recovery startup business could also claim the employee retention credit for wages paid after September 30, 2021, and before January 1, 2022. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **Credit for COBRA premium assistance payments is limited to periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021.** Section 9501 of the ARP provides for COBRA premium assistance in the form of a full reduction in the premium otherwise payable by certain individuals and their families who elect COBRA continuation coverage due to a loss of coverage as the result of a reduction in hours or an involuntary termination of employment (assistance eligible individuals). This COBRA premium assistance is available for periods of coverage beginning on or after April 1, 2021, through periods of coverage beginning on or before September 30, 2021. For more information, see _chapter 2_. **The CARES Act provided for a temporary increase in the contribution limit for traditional IRA contributions made by employees who were not covered by a retirement plan at work during 2020.** Under section 72(t)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the CARES Act, the maximum amount that may be contributed to a traditional IRA for the 2020 tax year was increased from $6,000 to $7,000 for individuals who did not participate in a workplace retirement plan during 2020. This provision applies only to contributions made to traditional IRAs, not to Roth IRAs. Contributions to traditional IRAs are generally deductible on an individual’s federal income tax return, while contributions to Roth IRAs are made with aftertax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.   \n",

These recovery methods allow you to deduct part of your cost each year. In this way, you are able to recover your capital expense. See _Amortization_ (chapter 8) and _Dealization_ (chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can elect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction. A greater portion of these costs can be deducted if the property is qualified disaster assistance property. See Pub. 946 for details.   \n",

If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records. For example, you can deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. However, only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction.   \n",

An excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you pay to an employee that is more than the business-related expenses for which the employee adequately accounted. The employee must return any excess reimbursement or other expense allowance to you within a reasonable period of time. If the employee fails to do so, you may treat it as taxable income.   \n",
