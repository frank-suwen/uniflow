    "For this example, we're using a [10K from Nike](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to `uniflow` conda environment to run this notebook. You can set up the environment following the instruction: https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to run the code. Once you have the key, set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` within a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository. For more details, see this [instruction](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#api-keys)\n",

Your employees must adequately account to you for their travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. They must give you documentary evidence of their travel, mileage, and other employee business expenses. This evidence should include items such as receipts, along with either a statement of expenses, an account book, a day planner, or similar record in which the employee entered each expense at or near the time the expense was incurred. The evidence should be kept by your employees for at least one year after the date of the expense.

An excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you pay to an employee that is more than the business-related expenses for which the employee adequately accounted. The employee must return any excess reimbursement or other expense allowance to you within a reasonable period of time. If the employee fails to do so, you may have to treat it as taxable income and report it on your Form W-2.                         What happens if an employee fails to return excess reimbursement or allowance?   \n",

These costs are a part of your investment in your business and are called 'capital expenses.' Capital expenses are considered assets in your business. In general, you capitalize three types of costs. * Business startup costs (see _Tip_ below). * Business assets. * Improvements. You can elect to deduct or amortize certain business startup costs. See chapters 7 and 8.                                What are the three types of costs that businesses typically capitalize?   \n",
       "2                                    ### Cost recovery Although you generally cannot take a current deduction for a capital expense, you may be able to recover the amount you spend through deprecation, amortization, or depletion. These recovery methods allow you to deduct part of your cost each year. In this way, you are able to recover your capital expense. See _Amortization_ (chapter 8) and _Dealization_ (chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can elect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction. A greater portion of these costs can be deducted if the property is qualified disaster assistance property. See Pub. 946 for details.

These costs may include expenses for advertising, travel, or wages for training employees. Capital expenses can be financed through loans from banks or other financial institutions.

Usually, you recover costs for a particular asset through depreciation. Generally, you cannot recover other costs until you sell the business or otherwise go out of business. However, you can choose to amortize certain costs for setting up your business. See _Starting a Business in chapter 8_ for more information on business startup costs.                                   What should be treated as capital expenses when starting a business?   \n",

       "115  ### Reimbursers A \"reimbursement or allowance arrangement\" provides for payment of advances, reimbursments, and allowances for travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses incurred by your employees during the ordinary course of business. If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records. For example, you can deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. However, only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction.                                                      What is a reimbursement or allowance arrangement?   \n",

Your employees must adequately account to you for their travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. They must give you documentary evidence of their travel, mileage, and other employee business expenses. This evidence should include items such as receipts, along with either a statement of expenses, an account book, a day planner, or similar record in which the employee entered each expense at or near the time the expense was incurred. The evidence should be kept by your employees for at least one year after the date of the expense.

An excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you pay to an employee that is more than the business-related expenses for which the employee adequately accounted. The employee must return any excess reimbursement or other expense allowance to you within a reasonable period of time. If the employee fails to do so, you may have to treat it as taxable income and report it on your Form W-2.
